To build a Yocto image for the Moxa UC-1222A using the .itb file from the official Moxa Industrial Linux 3 image, follow these steps:
1. Extract Information from the .itb File

Since your .itb file contains the kernel, DTB, initrd, and DTBO, you first need to extract its contents to inspect them.
Extract the .itb File

mkdir extracted_itb && cd extracted_itb
dumpimage -T flat_dt -i path/to/your.itb -p 0 kernel
dumpimage -T flat_dt -i path/to/your.itb -p 1 dtb
dumpimage -T flat_dt -i path/to/your.itb -p 2 initrd
dumpimage -T flat_dt -i path/to/your.itb -p 3 dtbo

If you're unsure of the partition numbers, use:

dumpimage -l path/to/your.itb

This will list all components inside the .itb.

Once extracted, verify each file:

file kernel dtb initrd dtbo

2. Identify the Kernel Version and Toolchain

Since the .itb contains a pre-built kernel, you need to determine the kernel version:

strings kernel | grep "Linux version"

Example output:

Linux version 5.10.100 (gcc version 10.3.0 (GCC)) #1 SMP Mon Dec 11 12:34:56 UTC 2023

This tells you:

    Kernel version: 5.10.100
    Compiler used: GCC 10.3.0
    Build date: December 11, 2023

You also need to determine the toolchain used by Moxa. If you have access to the Moxa Industrial Linux SDK, check which gcc version they provide.
3. Set Up a Yocto Build Environment

Now, set up Yocto for TI AM642 (since the UC-1222A is based on this SoC).
Clone Yocto and Layers

mkdir ~/yocto-moxa
cd ~/yocto-moxa
git clone -b kirkstone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
git clone -b kirkstone git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
git clone -b kirkstone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-ti

Initialize Build Configuration

cd poky
source oe-init-build-env

4. Add Moxa-Specific Configuration

Since Moxa's UC-1222A uses a TI AM642, you need to add meta-ti support.

Edit conf/bblayers.conf:

BBLAYERS += " ${HOME}/yocto-moxa/meta-openembedded/meta-oe "
BBLAYERS += " ${HOME}/yocto-moxa/meta-ti "

Modify conf/local.conf:

MACHINE = "am64xx-evm"
DISTRO = "poky"
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES = "debug-tweaks"

5. Add the Moxa Kernel and Device Tree

Since the extracted kernel and device tree (dtb) are from Moxa's firmware, you have two options:

    Use the extracted kernel as is (Not recommended for long-term Yocto integration)
    Build a new kernel from source using Yocto (Recommended)

Option 1: Use Extracted Kernel

Copy the extracted kernel, DTB, and initrd into the deploy directory of Yocto:

cp extracted_itb/kernel tmp/deploy/images/am64xx-evm/
cp extracted_itb/dtb tmp/deploy/images/am64xx-evm/
cp extracted_itb/initrd tmp/deploy/images/am64xx-evm/

Then modify your local.conf to specify them:

KERNEL_IMAGETYPE = "kernel"
UBOOT_MACHINE = "am64xx-evm"

Option 2: Build Kernel from Source

If you want to build the kernel from source, check if Moxa provides kernel source. If they donâ€™t, use the TI Linux kernel for AM642.

    Add the meta-ti kernel recipe:

bitbake virtual/kernel

    Extract Moxaâ€™s DTB and DTBO and compare with TIâ€™s default dts:

dtc -I dtb -O dts -o extracted.dts extracted_itb/dtb

    Modify meta-ti/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-ti-staging.bb to include Moxa-specific DTB modifications.

6. Build and Deploy the Yocto Image

Once your configuration is set, build your image:

bitbake core-image-minimal

After building, flash the image to your device using:

dd if=tmp/deploy/images/am64xx-evm/core-image-minimal-am64xx-evm.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress

Replace /dev/sdX with your actual storage device.
7. Boot and Debug

Once flashed, connect to the Moxa UC-1222A via serial/UART, power it on, and check the boot logs:

screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

If the boot fails, adjust:

    The kernel version
    The device tree (dts)
    The initrd settings

Next Steps

    Identify proprietary drivers used in the Moxa kernel and integrate them into Yocto.
    Add Moxa-specific services (systemd, scripts).
    Enable BLE and UART communication for your project.

Would you like me to help write a custom Yocto layer for the Moxa UC-1222A? ðŸš€
You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

I'll guide you through creating a custom Yocto layer for the Moxa UC-1222A, which will:

    Define the machine configuration for UC-1222A.
    Integrate the kernel and device tree.
    Customize u-boot and rootfs settings.
    Add Moxa-specific packages if needed.

1. Create a Custom Yocto Layer

Navigate to your Yocto build directory and create a new layer:

cd ~/yocto-moxa/poky
source oe-init-build-env
cd ..
bitbake-layers create-layer meta-moxa-uc1222a

This will create the directory meta-moxa-uc1222a with a standard structure.
2. Add the Layer to Yocto

Edit conf/bblayers.conf in the build directory:

BBLAYERS += "${HOME}/yocto-moxa/meta-moxa-uc1222a"

3. Define the Machine Configuration

Create a new machine configuration file for the Moxa UC-1222A:

mkdir -p meta-moxa-uc1222a/conf/machine
nano meta-moxa-uc1222a/conf/machine/moxa-uc1222a.conf

Paste the following:

# Machine Configuration for Moxa UC-1222A
DESCRIPTION = "Moxa UC-1222A Industrial Computer"
require conf/machine/include/ti-soc.inc

MACHINE = "moxa-uc1222a"
MACHINE_FEATURES += "usb host"

# Kernel settings
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-moxa"
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-moxa = "5.10%"

# Bootloader
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader = "u-boot-moxa"
UBOOT_MACHINE = "am64xx-evm"

# Root filesystem
IMAGE_FSTYPES = "wic.gz ext4"

# Console
SERIAL_CONSOLES = "115200;ttyS0"
SERIAL_CONSOLES_CHECK = "${SERIAL_CONSOLES}"

4. Create a Kernel Recipe

We will create a custom kernel recipe for the Moxa UC-1222A.
4.1 Create Kernel Directory

mkdir -p meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-kernel/linux
cd meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-kernel/linux

4.2 Create Kernel Recipe

Create the recipe file:

nano linux-moxa_5.10.bb

Paste the following:

DESCRIPTION = "Linux kernel for Moxa UC-1222A"
SECTION = "kernel"
LICENSE = "GPL-2.0"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=b23ba0ba8ee9b5c8ee9805630c17c8c5"

SRC_URI = "git://github.com/Moxa-Linux/linux-5.10.git;branch=moxa-uc1222a \
           file://defconfig"

SRCREV = "HEAD"

inherit kernel

S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

# Use Moxa-specific defconfig
do_configure:prepend() {
    cp ${WORKDIR}/defconfig ${S}/arch/arm64/configs/moxa_uc1222a_defconfig
}

5. Add Device Tree Support

Extract the DTB from the .itb file:

dtc -I dtb -O dts -o moxa-uc1222a.dts extracted_itb/dtb

Place the moxa-uc1222a.dts in:

meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-kernel/linux/files/moxa-uc1222a.dts

Modify the kernel recipe to include the DTB:

KERNEL_DEVICETREE = "arch/arm64/boot/dts/moxa/moxa-uc1222a.dtb"

6. Create a U-Boot Recipe
6.1 Create U-Boot Directory

mkdir -p meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-bsp/u-boot
cd meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-bsp/u-boot

6.2 Create U-Boot Recipe

nano u-boot-moxa_2021.10.bb

Paste this:

DESCRIPTION = "U-Boot bootloader for Moxa UC-1222A"
LICENSE = "GPL-2.0"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://Licenses/gpl-2.0.txt;md5=b234ee4d69f5fce4486a80fdaf4a4263"

SRC_URI = "git://github.com/Moxa-Linux/u-boot-moxa.git;branch=moxa-uc1222a"

SRCREV = "HEAD"
PV = "2021.10"

DEPENDS = "dtc"

S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

inherit u-boot

UBOOT_MACHINE = "moxa-uc1222a_defconfig"

7. Build Yocto Image

Now, configure Yocto to use the Moxa UC-1222A:

cd ~/yocto-moxa/poky
source oe-init-build-env

Edit conf/local.conf:

MACHINE = "moxa-uc1222a"

Run the build:

bitbake core-image-minimal

8. Flash the Image

After the build, flash the image to your Moxa UC-1222A:

dd if=tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-minimal-moxa-uc1222a.wic of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress

Connect via serial:

screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

Next Steps

    Optimize the RootFS: Add support for Bluetooth, UART, and custom services.
    Test Kernel Drivers: Verify hardware support for GPIO, USB, and UART.
    Integrate BLE Communication: Add packages for BLE communication with Arduino.

You said:
the uboot of the moxa is different than the standard, maybe for security, and how to change it
ChatGPT said:

If Moxa UC-1222A uses a custom U-Boot with modifications for security (e.g., secure boot, signed images, custom boot flow), we need to extract, analyze, and modify it. Hereâ€™s how to proceed step by step.
1. Extract and Analyze Moxaâ€™s U-Boot

Before modifying U-Boot, you need to extract the existing U-Boot binary from the .itb or flash storage.
1.1 Extract U-Boot from the Moxa Image

Check if the U-Boot binary is inside your Moxa firmware:

binwalk -e path/to/moxa-image.itb

If U-Boot is inside, it will be extracted into a folder like _moxa-image.itb.extracted/.

Alternatively, if the board is running, dump U-Boot directly from /dev/mtd:

cat /dev/mtd0 > u-boot.bin

Replace /dev/mtd0 with the correct partition.
1.2 Identify U-Boot Modifications

Run:

strings u-boot.bin | grep "U-Boot"

Look for:

    Custom build strings (e.g., MOXA Secure U-Boot).
    Secure Boot references (e.g., FIRMWARE_VERIFICATION, RSA_SIGN_CHECK).
    Custom environment variables.

To see if U-Boot enforces Secure Boot:

hexdump -C u-boot.bin | less

Search for "FIT_SIGNATURE", "RSA", or "HAB".

If Secure Boot is enabled, it likely requires signed images.
2. Modify U-Boot
2.1 Get the Moxa U-Boot Source

Check if Moxa provides source code in their Moxa Industrial Linux SDK or on their website.

If not available, we have two options:

    Reverse-engineer the U-Boot binary (complex).
    Patch a similar U-Boot (TI AM642) and bypass security checks.

Since UC-1222A is based on the TI AM642, we can use the TI U-Boot and apply patches.
2.2 Clone TI U-Boot

Set up the U-Boot build environment:

mkdir -p ~/yocto-moxa/u-boot-moxa
cd ~/yocto-moxa/u-boot-moxa
git clone -b v2021.10 git://git.ti.com/git/ti-u-boot.git
cd ti-u-boot

2.3 Apply Moxa Patches

If you extracted u-boot.bin earlier, compare it with standard TI U-Boot:

diff -u ti-u-boot/arch/arm/boot/u-boot.bin extracted/u-boot.bin

Common modifications Moxa may have:

    Secure Boot checks in common/image-fit.c.
    Board-specific boot flow in board/moxa/uc1222a/.

You can bypass signature verification by modifying:

int fit_image_verify_required(...) {
    return 0; // Bypass signature check
}

Or log changes with:

printf("MOXA Secure Boot check bypassed\n");

2.4 Configure U-Boot for UC-1222A

Modify configs/am64xx_evm_defconfig:

CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE=0x80000000
CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=3
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x40000
CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT=n

Compile:

make am64xx_evm_defconfig
make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

3. Flash the New U-Boot

If Moxa has Secure Boot, it might prevent unsigned U-Boot from running. In that case:

    Backup the existing U-Boot
    Write the new one manually

Check the U-Boot partition:

cat /proc/mtd

Flash the new U-Boot:

flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 0
dd if=u-boot.bin of=/dev/mtd0

Reboot and check:

reboot
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

Next Steps

    If Secure Boot prevents booting, we need to extract and modify the bootloader signature keys.
    If you get a BootROM Authentication Failure, we need to patch U-Boot to fake verification.

Would you like me to help bypass Secure Boot or extract the bootloader signing keys? ðŸš€

i want first to test the .itb from moxa and rootfs from yocto how to do it
ChatGPT said:

If you want to test Moxa's .itb (kernel, DTB, initrd) while using Yocto's rootfs, follow these steps:
1. Extract the .itb from the Moxa Image

If you haven't extracted it yet:

mkdir extracted_itb && cd extracted_itb
dumpimage -l path/to/moxa.itb

This will list the components inside. Extract them:

dumpimage -T flat_dt -i path/to/moxa.itb -p 0 kernel
dumpimage -T flat_dt -i path/to/moxa.itb -p 1 dtb
dumpimage -T flat_dt -i path/to/moxa.itb -p 2 initrd

2. Build Yocto Root Filesystem

Ensure Yocto is set up to build a minimal root filesystem:

cd ~/yocto-moxa/poky
source oe-init-build-env
bitbake core-image-minimal

Once built, locate the root filesystem:

ls tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-minimal-moxa-uc1222a.rootfs.ext4

3. Flash Moxa Kernel & Yocto RootFS

Since we are keeping Moxa's kernel and DTB but replacing the rootfs, we need to modify the boot process.
3.1 Flash the Moxa .itb to the Boot Partition

If Moxa stores the .itb on a boot partition (e.g., /dev/mmcblk0p1):

dd if=path/to/moxa.itb of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=4M status=progress

3.2 Flash the Yocto RootFS

Find where the rootfs is stored. On Moxa devices, it's usually /dev/mmcblk0p2:

mount | grep root

If itâ€™s /dev/mmcblk0p2, flash it:

dd if=tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-minimal-moxa-uc1222a.rootfs.ext4 of=/dev/mmcblk0p2 bs=4M status=progress
sync

4. Boot with Moxa Kernel & Yocto RootFS

Reboot the device:

reboot

Monitor the serial output:

screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

Once booted, check if youâ€™re using the Yocto rootfs:

cat /etc/os-release

It should show Poky (Yocto) instead of Moxa Industrial Linux.
5. Fix Potential Issues
5.1 Adjust Kernel Command Line

If it fails to mount /root, check the kernel boot arguments:

cat /proc/cmdline

Ensure root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 is set correctly. If not, modify U-Boot:

setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw
saveenv
boot

5.2 Ensure Compatibility with Yoctoâ€™s Init System

Check if the Moxa kernel supports systemd or sysvinit:

ls /sbin/init

    If it exists, Yoctoâ€™s init system should work.
    If Moxa expects a different init system, you may need to adjust /etc/inittab or /sbin/init.

Next Steps

    If the system boots fine, you can incrementally replace Moxaâ€™s components (e.g., adding a Yocto kernel).
    If issues arise, check logs: dmesg, journalctl, or /var/log/.

Goal

You want to build a Yocto root filesystem (rootfs) for the Moxa UC-1222A, while keeping Moxaâ€™s .itb (which contains the kernel, DTB, initrd, and overlays). Below are the full steps:
1. Setup Yocto Environment
1.1 Install Dependencies

Ensure your system has the required dependencies for Yocto:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib \
     build-essential chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect \

3. Create Custom Recipes for Using Moxaâ€™s .itb

We need to skip kernel and bootloader compilation while keeping them in place.
3.1 Kernel Recipe to Use Moxa's .itb

Create:

mkdir -p ~/yocto-moxa/meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-kernel/moxa-prebuilt-kernel
nano ~/yocto-moxa/meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-kernel/moxa-prebuilt-kernel/moxa-prebuilt-kernel.bb

}

FILES_${PN} += "/boot/moxa.itb"
PROVIDES += "virtual/kernel"

3.2 Bootloader Recipe to Use Moxa's U-Boot

Create:

mkdir -p ~/yocto-moxa/meta-moxa-uc1222a/recipes-bsp/moxa-prebuilt-bootloader

PROVIDES += "virtual/bootloader"

4. Build the Yocto RootFS

Now, run:

cd ~/yocto-moxa/poky
source oe-init-build-env
bitbake core-image-minimal

After the build, the root filesystem will be at:

ls tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-minimal-moxa-uc1222a.rootfs.ext4

5. Flash and Test the Image
5.1 Flash the .itb and U-Boot (If Needed)

If you need to reflash the Moxa kernel (.itb), do:

dd if=path/to/moxa.itb of=/dev/mmcblk0p1 bs=4M status=progress

Flash U-Boot (if required):

dd if=path/to/u-boot.bin of=/dev/mtd0 bs=4M status=progress

5.2 Flash Yocto RootFS

Find the correct root partition (/dev/mmcblk0p2 or /dev/mmcblk1p2):

mount | grep root

Then, flash the new Yocto rootfs:

dd if=tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-minimal-moxa-uc1222a.rootfs.ext4 of=/dev/mmcblk0p2 bs=4M status=progress
sync

6. Boot and Debug

Reboot the system:

reboot

Monitor serial output:

screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

If the system fails to boot:

    Check U-Boot settings:

printenv
setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw
saveenv
boot

    Check logs:

dmesg | grep error
journalctl -xe

Next Steps

    If Boot Fails: Adjust kernel command line in U-Boot.
    Optimize RootFS: Add custom packages (bitbake core-image-full-cmdline).
    Add Network/BLE Support: Enable required drivers.

with the moxa sqrootfs there was a sqrootfs.sha256
ChatGPT said:

If Moxaâ€™s SquashFS (sqrootfs) includes a SHA-256 checksum file (sqrootfs.sha256), this means that U-Boot or the boot process verifies the integrity of the root filesystem before booting.

To integrate Yoctoâ€™s SquashFS rootfs while preserving the same security mechanism, we need to generate a SHA-256 checksum for our new SquashFS image.
1. Generate SHA-256 for Yoctoâ€™s SquashFS

After building Yoctoâ€™s rootfs, locate it:

ls tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs

Now, generate the SHA-256 checksum:

sha256sum tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs > tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs.sha256

Compare this with Moxaâ€™s original SHA-256 file:

cat path/to/original/sqrootfs.sha256
cat tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs.sha256

If the format differs, modify the new .sha256 file accordingly.
2. Flash Yoctoâ€™s SquashFS and SHA-256 File

First, check where the rootfs is stored:

mount | grep root

If itâ€™s /dev/mmcblk0p2, flash the new rootfs:

dd if=tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs of=/dev/mmcblk0p2 bs=4M status=progress

Then, copy the SHA-256 file:

cp tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs.sha256 /mnt/boot/
sync

Ensure the checksum matches:

sha256sum -c /mnt/boot/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs.sha256

3. Modify U-Boot (If Required)

If U-Boot verifies the checksum, check the bootloader environment:

printenv

Look for variables related to checksum verification, such as:

verify_rootfs=sha256sum /mnt/boot/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs

If needed, update:

setenv verify_rootfs "sha256sum /mnt/boot/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs"
saveenv
reboot

4. Reboot and Debug

Reboot the system:

reboot

Monitor logs:

dmesg | grep -i root
journalctl -xe

If thereâ€™s an issue, check:

    If U-Boot rejects the SquashFS due to checksum mismatch.
    If the rootfs fails to mount due to incorrect kernel command line (printenv in U-Boot).

Next Steps

    If Boot Fails: Investigate bootargs in U-Boot.
    Optimize RootFS: Reduce unnecessary packages.
    Secure System: Disable root SSH, enable firewall.

Would you like help debugging the U-Boot environment or analyzing Moxaâ€™s checksum mechanism? ðŸš€

Debugging Moxaâ€™s U-Boot and SHA-256 Checksum Verification

Since Moxaâ€™s U-Boot verifies the SHA-256 checksum of the SquashFS (sqrootfs), we need to analyze how U-Boot handles the verification and bypass or modify it if necessary.
1. Check U-Boot's Boot Process
1.1 Print U-Boot Environment Variables

Connect to the Moxa UC-1222A over serial and enter U-Boot console by pressing a key when prompted.

Run:

printenv

Look for any variable related to checksum verification, such as:

verify_rootfs=sha256sum /mnt/boot/sqrootfs.sqfs
bootcmd=run verify_rootfs; bootm

If you find a command like sha256sum in bootcmd, that means U-Boot refuses to boot if the checksum is invalid.
1.2 List MTD Partitions

Check where Moxa stores U-Boot and rootfs:

cat /proc/mtd

Look for something like:

dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 00080000 00001000 "u-boot"
mtd1: 00200000 00001000 "kernel"
mtd2: 02000000 00001000 "rootfs"

Identify where U-Boot reads the checksum file.
2. Bypass or Modify U-Bootâ€™s Checksum Verification
Option 1: Temporarily Bypass in U-Boot

If U-Boot refuses to boot due to checksum mismatch, temporarily bypass it by modifying bootcmd:

setenv bootcmd "bootm"
saveenv
boot

This will force boot without checking SHA-256.
Option 2: Modify U-Boot Environment

To permanently disable checksum verification, modify verify_rootfs:

setenv verify_rootfs "true"
saveenv

If bootcmd includes checksum verification, modify it:

setenv bootcmd "run load_kernel; bootm"
saveenv

Reboot and test:

reboot

Option 3: Patch U-Bootâ€™s SHA-256 Verification in Source Code

If Moxaâ€™s U-Boot is hardened and ignores environment changes, we need to patch U-Boot's source code.

    Extract U-Boot binary from flash

dd if=/dev/mtd0 of=u-boot.bin

    Disassemble and analyze

strings u-boot.bin | grep sha256
hexdump -C u-boot.bin | less

Look for something like:

verify_sha256()

If found, patch it with:

int verify_sha256(...) {
    return 0; // Bypass security check
}

Recompile and flash the patched U-Boot:

dd if=u-boot-patched.bin of=/dev/mtd0

3. Flashing a New SHA-256 Checksum for the Yocto RootFS

If you want to keep SHA-256 verification but update it, generate a new checksum:

    Generate a SHA-256 checksum for the new rootfs:

sha256sum tmp/deploy/images/moxa-uc1222a/core-image-moxa-moxa-uc1222a.sqfs > sqrootfs.sha256

    Copy it to Moxaâ€™s boot partition:

cp sqrootfs.sha256 /mnt/boot/
sync

    Verify that U-Boot accepts it:

sha256sum -c /mnt/boot/sqrootfs.sha256

    Reboot and check:

reboot

Next Steps

    If U-Boot ignores modifications, we need to patch the binary.
    If SHA-256 fails, compare it with Moxaâ€™s original:

cat path/to/original/sqrootfs.sha256

Patching or Recompiling U-Boot for Moxa UC-1222A

Since Moxa has modified U-Boot, possibly for security (SHA-256 verification, secure boot, or signature checks), we need to extract, analyze, and modify U-Boot to either bypass or recompile it.
Step 1: Extract the Existing U-Boot
1.1 Identify U-Boot Partition

Check MTD partitions:

cat /proc/mtd

Example output:

dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 00080000 00001000 "u-boot"
mtd1: 00200000 00001000 "kernel"
mtd2: 02000000 00001000 "rootfs"

U-Boot is usually in mtd0.
1.2 Dump U-Boot from Flash

Backup U-Boot:

dd if=/dev/mtd0 of=u-boot-moxa.bin

Verify:

file u-boot-moxa.bin
strings u-boot-moxa.bin | grep -i "u-boot"

Step 2: Analyze and Bypass SHA-256 Verification
2.1 Search for SHA-256 Checks

Use strings to locate possible security checks:

strings u-boot-moxa.bin | grep -i "sha256"

If it returns:

sha256sum mismatch
Secure Boot enabled
Boot failed: invalid signature

Moxa validates the rootfs checksum before booting.
2.2 Disassemble U-Boot Binary

To find the function responsible:

objdump -D -b binary -m arm64 -M cortex-a53 u-boot-moxa.bin | less

Look for functions handling SHA-256 verification.

If you find something like:

cmp x0, x1
beq success
b fail_boot

Change beq success to always succeed:

mov x0, x1

Then, patch it:

hexedit u-boot-moxa.bin

Modify the corresponding instruction to bypass the check.
Step 3: Recompile a Custom U-Boot

If we cannot patch the binary directly, we need to recompile U-Boot from source.
3.1 Get the TI U-Boot Source (Base for AM642)

Clone the TI U-Boot repository:

mkdir -p ~/yocto-moxa/u-boot-moxa
cd ~/yocto-moxa/u-boot-moxa
git clone -b v2021.10 git://git.ti.com/git/ti-u-boot.git
cd ti-u-boot

3.2 Apply Moxa-Specific Changes

If Moxa provides source code, use it. Otherwise, modify the TI U-Boot:

    Identify the U-Boot board configuration:

ls configs/am64xx_evm_defconfig

    Modify it:

nano configs/am64xx_evm_defconfig

    Disable SHA-256 verification:

CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT=n
CONFIG_SHA256=n
CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND="bootm"

    Ensure boot continues without checksum:

nano common/image-fit.c

Modify:

int fit_image_verify_required(...) {
    return 0; // Bypass security check
}

3.3 Build U-Boot

Set up the cross-compiler:

export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
make am64xx_evm_defconfig
make -j4

The compiled U-Boot binary will be u-boot.bin.
Step 4: Flash the New U-Boot
4.1 Backup Old U-Boot

Before flashing, back up again:

dd if=/dev/mtd0 of=/root/u-boot-backup.bin

4.2 Flash Patched U-Boot

If using mtd:

flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 0
dd if=u-boot.bin of=/dev/mtd0
sync

If using U-Boot shell:

tftpboot 0x82000000 u-boot.bin
sf probe
sf erase 0x0 0x80000
sf write 0x82000000 0x0 0x80000

Step 5: Reboot and Test

Reboot and check:

reboot
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

If the boot fails:

    Restore backup:

dd if=/root/u-boot-backup.bin of=/dev/mtd0

    Debug using:

printenv
dmesg | grep -i boot

Next Steps

    If Secure Boot Blocks the New U-Boot: We need to extract Moxaâ€™s bootloader keys.
    If It Boots but Fails to Load RootFS: Adjust the U-Boot environment.
