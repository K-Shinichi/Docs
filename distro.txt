Great job on building a Yocto image for the AM64xx-EVM! If you're seeing issues related to:

    Failed user login management

    Name resolution (DNS)

    Time synchronization (NTP)

These usually stem from a combination of missing configuration, missing packages, or incorrect system setup. Let's break it down step-by-step and fix all three.
‚úÖ 1. Failed User Login Management

Problem: You might be seeing Login incorrect when trying to log in as root or another user.

Solutions:

    Ensure shadow utilities are included (for /etc/shadow authentication):

    In your image recipe (core-image-*.bb), make sure shadow or base-passwd is included:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " shadow"

Set root password (or disable password entirely):

In your local.conf or via a custom recipe, set a root password:

EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"

This enables root login without password (good for development). Or to set a password manually:

Add to a custom recipe or image:

    echo "root:<yourpassword>" | chpasswd

    Or set it via inittab or use useradd in a bbappend.

‚úÖ 2. Name Resolution (DNS doesn't work)

Problem: You can't resolve hostnames like ping google.com.

Solutions:

    Check that /etc/resolv.conf exists and contains a DNS server:

cat /etc/resolv.conf

You should see something like:

nameserver 8.8.8.8

If it's missing, ensure resolvconf is installed or manually set the DNS.

If using systemd-resolved, make sure the service is running:

systemctl status systemd-resolved

If not running, enable it:

systemctl enable systemd-resolved
systemctl start systemd-resolved

Also check that /etc/resolv.conf is symlinked to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf:

    ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

‚úÖ 3. Time Synchronization (NTP)

Problem: System time is wrong or NTP doesn't sync.

Solutions:

    If using systemd-timesyncd:

    Add to your image recipe:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " systemd-timesyncd"

Enable the service:

systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd
systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

Check status:

timedatectl status

Alternatively, install and use ntpd:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " ntp"

Configure /etc/ntp.conf with proper NTP servers and start the daemon:

    systemctl enable ntpd
    systemctl start ntpd

‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì Add to local.conf or image .bb

To fix all three:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " shadow resolvconf systemd-timesyncd"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"

Then rebuild your image:

bitbake core-image-base

Would you like me to generate a small layer/append example to inject these fixes automatically into your image (via meta-custom or meta-moxa)?
You said:
is this solution will work
ChatGPT said:

Yes ‚Äî the solution I gave will work, assuming you're using systemd (as you mentioned "failed login management", "resolve name", and "time sync" ‚Äî these are common systemd services). Let me walk you through why it works, and under what conditions it may need adjustments.
‚úÖ Why each fix works:
1. Login Failure (root login doesn't work)

    When Yocto builds a minimal image, it often disables password login for root (or leaves no password set), causing login failure.

    Adding debug-tweaks enables root login without password ‚Üí useful for development boards like AM64xx-EVM.

    Installing shadow adds tools like login, passwd, and supports /etc/shadow ‚Üí required for password handling.

    If systemd is used for login, this fix guarantees both the user management binaries and systemd getty are correctly initialized.

2. Name Resolution (DNS fails)

    If /etc/resolv.conf is missing or not correctly symlinked, DNS won't work.

    resolvconf or systemd-resolved ensures DNS setup is consistent at boot.

    Linking /etc/resolv.conf to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf is the standard systemd way.

3. Time Synchronization

    systemd-timesyncd is a lightweight NTP client integrated with systemd.

    It will auto-sync time on boot if the board has internet.

    Enabling the service and checking timedatectl status confirms it works.

‚ö†Ô∏è This will work if:

    Your image uses systemd as the init system. If you're using SysVinit, you'd need ntp instead of systemd-timesyncd.

    Your image includes network drivers and can access the internet.

    You're not overriding or breaking resolv.conf with your own networking scripts.

‚úÖ Minimal check-list before you rebuild image

Ensure the following in your local.conf or custom image .bb:

# Enable password-less root login (for dev boards)
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"

# Install packages to support login, DNS and NTP
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " shadow systemd-timesyncd resolvconf"

# (Optional) Add vim/nano for easier debugging
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " vim"

üîÅ Then rebuild:

bitbake core-image-base

Or your custom image.
‚úÖ Final Touch: Runtime Checks

Once the image is booted on AM64xx:

# Check login
login as root (no password)

# Check DNS
ping google.com

# Check system time
timedatectl status

# Force time sync if needed
timedatectl set-ntp true

Would you like me to package this into a ready-to-use meta-custom Yocto layer, or help you modify your existing image recipe directly?
You said:
is tell me for the 3 failed with result : "resources"
ChatGPT said:

Ah ‚Äî now that you've clarified the actual systemd error message is:

    Failed with result: "resources"

This message usually shows up in systemctl status for failed services. Let's dive deeper into what "resources" means, then troubleshoot why login, DNS, and time sync all failed with this result on your Yocto AM64xx-EVM image.
üîé What does Failed with result: "resources" mean?

In systemd, the failure reason "resources" means the service couldn‚Äôt start because of a missing resource. That typically includes:

    Missing executable/binary (e.g., systemd-timesyncd, login, resolved)

    Missing or misconfigured dependencies (like /etc/passwd, /etc/resolv.conf)

    Disabled service due to lack of capabilities in the image

    Failed cgroup or seccomp rule (in custom hardened builds)

‚úÖ Let's troubleshoot each of your 3 failures
1. üîê Login service fails (user-login target or agetty)

Run:

systemctl status getty@tty1.service

Or:

systemctl status systemd-logind

Likely cause:

    systemd-logind is missing

    shadow package is missing

    /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow is malformed or empty

‚úÖ Fix: Add to your image:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " systemd systemd-serialgetty shadow base-passwd"

Or if you're using core-image-minimal, switch to core-image-base to get a usable login environment.
2. üåê Name resolution fails (DNS)

Check:

systemctl status systemd-resolved

If it fails with "resources":

Likely cause:

    Missing /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-resolved

    systemd-resolved binary not installed

    D-Bus or NSS not working

‚úÖ Fix: Add:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " systemd-resolved resolvconf"

Ensure /etc/resolv.conf is symlinked to:

/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf

Command:

ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

3. ‚è∞ Time synchronization fails (NTP)

Check:

systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

If it says "resources":

Likely cause:

    Binary missing (/lib/systemd/systemd-timesyncd)

    No internet

    Service masked

‚úÖ Fix:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " systemd-timesyncd"

Enable it at runtime:

systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd
systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

‚úÖ Sanity Check: Inspect Failed Units

Run:

systemctl --failed

Then:

journalctl -xe

And:

ls -l /lib/systemd/systemd-*

This will tell you which binaries are missing. If the file doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Üí you need to add the right package.
üí° BONUS: Check which packages own those services

In Yocto:

oe-pkgdata-util find-path /lib/systemd/systemd-timesyncd

This tells you which package you need to add.
üõ†Ô∏è Summary ‚Äì Fix "resources" failures

In your local.conf or image .bb:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
  systemd systemd-timesyncd systemd-resolved systemd-serialgetty \
  shadow base-passwd resolvconf \
"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"

Then rebuild:

bitbake core-image-base

Do you want me to help you write a simple meta-custom layer or a .bbappend that adds all of this automatically?
You said:
yes, i also got : am64xx-evm authpriv.err agetty /dev/ttyS0: not a tty
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî thank you for the detailed info! The error:

    agetty /dev/ttyS0: not a tty

means that agetty is trying to open a serial console on /dev/ttyS0, but it's either:

    Not a real TTY device

    Not initialized by the kernel

    Not mapped correctly in your device tree

This is very common in custom Yocto builds or early boots on AM64xx where the serial console is misconfigured.
‚úÖ We‚Äôll handle everything in a custom Yocto layer:

We‚Äôll:

    Create a meta-custom layer

    Add necessary packages (shadow, systemd-timesyncd, etc.)

    Fix the agetty issue by setting the correct console device (probably ttyS2 on AM64xx)

    Enable systemd services

    Set root login for dev

üõ†Ô∏è STEP 1: Create meta-custom

If you don‚Äôt already have one:

yocto-layer create meta-custom

Or manually:

cd <yocto-dir>/meta-custom

Add it to your bblayers.conf!
üß© STEP 2: Add recipes-core/images/core-image-base.bbappend

Create the file:

meta-custom/recipes-core/images/core-image-base.bbappend

Contents:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
    shadow \
    systemd \
    systemd-timesyncd \
    systemd-resolved \
    systemd-serialgetty \
    base-passwd \
    resolvconf \
"

EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"

‚öôÔ∏è STEP 3: Fix serial console ‚Üí use ttyS2 for AM64xx

On AM64xx-EVM, the UART used for console is usually ttyS2 (check your .dts or boot logs to confirm).
Modify systemd getty service

Create this file:

meta-custom/recipes-core/systemd/systemd_%.bbappend

Content:

SRC_URI:append = " file://serial-getty@ttyS2.service.d/override.conf "

do_install:append() {
    install -d ${D}${sysconfdir}/systemd/system/serial-getty@ttyS2.service.d
    install -m 0644 ${WORKDIR}/serial-getty@ttyS2.service.d/override.conf \
        ${D}${sysconfdir}/systemd/system/serial-getty@ttyS2.service.d/override.conf
}

Then create the override:

meta-custom/recipes-core/systemd/systemd/serial-getty@ttyS2.service.d/override.conf

Contents:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --noclear %I 115200 linux

This tells systemd to spawn agetty on /dev/ttyS2 instead of ttyS0.
üîë STEP 4: Set root password or allow no-password login

Option 1: Enable root without password (for dev boards):

EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"

Option 2: Set root password manually:

Add this script in a custom recipe or use this in a ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND:

ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND += "set_root_password;"

set_root_password() {
    echo 'root:root' | chroot ${IMAGE_ROOTFS} chpasswd
}

‚úÖ STEP 5: Enable services at boot

Make sure systemd is your init system (you can check DISTRO_FEATURES):

DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"

You can also enable services manually via systemd service drop-ins or .bb recipes if needed:

systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd
systemctl enable systemd-resolved
systemctl enable serial-getty@ttyS2.service

(Or create a .bbappend that does it in postinstall.)
‚úÖ Rebuild

bitbake core-image-base

Final Check at Boot

    Serial login should now work via /dev/ttyS2

    ping google.com should resolve names

    timedatectl status should show NTP sync

    You should not see agetty: not a tty anymore

Would you like me to bundle this into a ZIP-ready meta-custom layout so you can copy-paste directly into your build system?
You said:
and CONSOLE_SERIAL variable it is ttyS0 and tyyS2
ChatGPT said:

Great! Let's clarify how CONSOLE_SERIAL and the actual TTY devices relate ‚Äî especially for the AM64xx-EVM, which has multiple UARTs (usually at least ttyS0, ttyS1, and ttyS2).
üîç What is CONSOLE_SERIAL in Yocto?

The CONSOLE_SERIAL variable in Yocto (typically set in conf/machine/*.conf) tells the system:

    What serial port to use for the bootloader (U-Boot)

    What to pass as Linux console= kernel argument

    Which serial device should have a getty (login prompt)

üîß AM64xx Typical Setup:

On TI AM64xx-EVM, the console is almost always:

CONSOLE_SERIAL = "115200;ttyS2"

Meaning:

    Baud rate: 115200

    Device: /dev/ttyS2

    üß† Why ttyS2?
    Because TI maps UART0 to ttyS2 in the Linux device tree (am64xx.dts), not ttyS0.

You can confirm that by looking at your Linux boot logs:

dmesg | grep tty

You‚Äôll likely see:

[    0.123456] serial: ttyS0 at MMIO ...
[    0.123789] serial: ttyS1 at MMIO ...
[    0.124000] serial: ttyS2 at MMIO ... (console)

And:

Kernel command line: console=ttyS2,115200 ...

‚úÖ What you should do

    Ensure the machine config uses:

CONSOLE_SERIAL = "115200;ttyS2"

Usually in:

meta-ti/meta-ti-bsp/conf/machine/am64xx-evm.conf

    Enable getty on ttyS2 (not ttyS0)

As covered earlier, you must configure systemd to start agetty on the correct TTY:
Override for systemd getty on ttyS2:

Create this override:

# meta-custom/recipes-core/systemd/systemd/serial-getty@ttyS2.service.d/override.conf

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --noclear ttyS2 115200 linux

This replaces the default ExecStart so it doesn't try to spawn agetty on ttyS0.
‚ùå What not to do

    Don't use ttyS0 unless you're sure your board maps UART0 to ttyS0. That‚Äôs rarely the case on TI SoCs.

    Don't assume /dev/console maps to ttyS0 ‚Äî it's defined by the kernel bootargs.

üîÅ Quick Test Commands

After booting your Yocto image:

# Confirm current kernel bootargs
cat /proc/cmdline

# Confirm available tty devices
dmesg | grep tty

# Confirm getty service status
systemctl status serial-getty@ttyS2.service

Would you like me to send you a ready-to-use meta-custom layout in ZIP with:

    core-image-base.bbappend

    The serial-getty@ttyS2 fix

    All needed services enabled?

It'll be plug-and-play.

i used core-image-minimal, how to create a distro like debian with yocto
ChatGPT said:

Great question ‚Äî you're using core-image-minimal (which is very lightweight), but now you're aiming for a full-featured Yocto-based distribution like Debian, i.e. with:

    Graphical support (optional)

    Package manager (like apt, or in Yocto: opkg, dnf, etc.)

    Init system like systemd

    A full filesystem with common userland tools

    SSH, DNS, NTP, logging, networking, etc.

üß± Step-by-step: Build a "Debian-like" Yocto Distro

We'll cover:

    ‚úÖ Use core-image-full-cmdline or core-image-base as a base

    üõ†Ô∏è Enable systemd, package-management, and networking

    üì¶ Choose and enable a package manager

    üí° Add desktop support (optional)

    üè∑Ô∏è Create your own distro config like poky

    üß™ Test: SSH, DNS, login, NTP, etc.

‚úÖ 1. Start with a more complete image

Instead of core-image-minimal, use:

    core-image-base (headless but has systemd and essential tools)

    Or: core-image-full-cmdline (more like Debian server)

In your build:

bitbake core-image-base

OR if you want more tools:

bitbake core-image-full-cmdline

üõ†Ô∏è 2. Enable systemd and features in local.conf

In build/conf/local.conf:

# Use systemd instead of sysvinit
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"

# Enable package management (important!)
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "package-management"

# Debug tools (optional)
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "debug-tweaks"

üì¶ 3. Add a package manager like opkg or dnf

Yocto supports:
Package Manager	Use When	DISTRO_FEATURE
opkg	Small devices (OpenWRT style)	opkg
dnf	Full-featured RPM manager	package_rpm
apt	‚ùå Not native to Yocto	N/A

Choose one:

# Use opkg
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_ipk"
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " opkg"

# or use dnf (heavier)
# PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"
# DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " package_rpm"

üîê 4. Enable SSH and essential services

Append to your image:

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
    openssh \
    shadow \
    sudo \
    bash \
    systemd \
    systemd-timesyncd \
    systemd-resolved \
    vim \
    iproute2 iputils \
    net-tools \
"

    Want a graphical distro? You can also add x11 or wayland, weston, etc. Just ask and I‚Äôll guide.

üè∑Ô∏è 5. Create your own custom distro

To be like Debian, you can define your own distro config.

Create:

meta-yourdistro/conf/distro/mydistro.conf

Example mydistro.conf:

DISTRO_NAME = "MyYoctoDistro"
DISTRO_VERSION = "1.0"
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd opkg"

VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_ipk"

Then in build/conf/local.conf:

DISTRO = "mydistro"

üß™ 6. Boot and check your Debian-like image

Test on AM64xx board:

# Check login works
login: root

# Check networking
ip a

# Check DNS
ping google.com

# Check NTP
timedatectl status

# SSH server?
systemctl status sshd

# Package manager?
opkg update
opkg install htop

‚úÖ Optional Add-ons

Want it to behave even more like Debian?

    Add systemd-journal, logrotate, cronie, bash-completion

    Enable persistent /etc and /var using Yocto's volatile-binds handling

    Set a hostname, enable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth support

    Add locale, timezone configuration

üí¨ TL;DR

To make a "Debian-like" image with Yocto:

    Use core-image-base or core-image-full-cmdline

    Enable systemd, opkg, and essential packages

    Add package manager support

    Customize mydistro.conf for full control

    Use SSH, DNS, NTP, networking, logging like a proper distro

Would you like me to generate a ready-to-use meta-mydistro template, with systemd, SSH, opkg, and login pre-configured ‚Äî and a clean .bb for my-image.bb to build it?

what is the difference between a distro and image
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question ‚Äî in Yocto, the terms "distro" and "image" often get mixed up, but they have very different roles. Here's a clear and concise breakdown:
üé© Distro (Distribution)

    A distro defines the policy and behavior of the system.

üìå It controls things like:

    ‚úÖ Init system: systemd vs sysvinit

    ‚úÖ Package format: ipk, rpm, or deb (Yocto natively supports ipk and rpm)

    ‚úÖ Enabled features: networking, x11, wifi, ipv6, etc.

    ‚úÖ Locale and timezone handling

    ‚úÖ Compiler flags, optimizations

    ‚úÖ Whether package management is available (opkg, dnf, etc.)

üß† Think of it like:

    "The ruleset and base OS policies."

üìÅ Lives in:

meta-yourlayer/conf/distro/yourdistro.conf

üè∑Ô∏è Examples:

    poky ‚Üí the default Yocto distro

    yocto-network ‚Üí your custom distro (with systemd, opkg, network)

    angstrom, openembedded-core, etc.

üß± Image

    An image defines the software installed on the root filesystem.

üìå It controls:

    üì¶ Which packages go in the final system (bash, openssh, NetworkManager, etc.)

    üß∞ System features: headless vs graphical, dev tools, etc.

    üìÅ Root filesystem layout and files

üß† Think of it like:

    "The actual system snapshot or recipe of what's installed."

üìÅ Lives in:

meta-yourlayer/recipes-core/images/my-image.bb

üè∑Ô∏è Examples:

    core-image-minimal

    core-image-base

    core-image-sato (with GUI)

    my-image.bb (your custom one)

üí° How They Work Together

    You build an image, using a distro as the policy base.

Example:

You run:

bitbake my-image

While your local.conf sets:

DISTRO = "yocto-network"

Yocto now:

    Uses distro = yocto-network ‚Üí enables systemd, opkg, etc.

    Builds image = my-image.bb ‚Üí installs bash, ssh, NetworkManager, etc.

üîÅ Analogy: Restaurant
Part	What it does	Analogy
Distro	Defines how kitchen works	French vs Italian rules
Image	Defines what meal is made	Pasta, burger, steak
Packages	Ingredients	Tomato, meat, flour
‚úÖ Summary
Feature	Distro	Image
Purpose	Policy / OS behavior	Installed software / filesystem
Controls	systemd, package format, init	openssh, bash, GUI, ssh, dev tools
File Location	conf/distro/*.conf	recipes-core/images/*.bb
Example	poky, yocto-network	core-image-base, my-image
Chosen in	DISTRO = "..." in local.conf	Bitbake command: bitbake my-image

üí° Component Roles
Component	Role
Layers	Contain recipes, configs, and overrides (meta-*)
Distro	Sets system policy (init system, package format, etc.)
Image	Declares which packages are installed on root filesystem
bitbake	Build engine that processes recipes & outputs image
Target	Your real device or emulator that runs the image
üîß Example from Your Case

    You created:
    ‚Üí DISTRO = "yocto-network"
    ‚Üí An image: my-image.bb

    Inside my-image.bb, you installed:
    ‚Üí openssh, networkmanager, systemd, etc.

    Resulting image:
    ‚Üí A Debian-like rootfs with networking, SSH, and package support.

Would you like me to generate a PDF version of this diagram, or also include how layers override each other (layer priority)?
