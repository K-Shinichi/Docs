Great! You're working on a Yocto image for the PhyGATE-Tauri S with RAUC support and a dedicated appfs partition for specific applications. That‚Äôs a solid use case for managing updates and keeping app data separate. Here's a breakdown of what you typically need to set this up properly.
‚úÖ High-Level Goals

    Yocto-based image for the PhyGATE-Tauri S.

    RAUC integration for A/B updates or single-slot OTA.

    Additional appfs partition mounted separately for your application binaries/data.

üß© 1. RAUC Integration

Make sure the following is in place:
local.conf additions:

DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " rauc"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " rauc"

Layers needed:

Ensure you include meta-rauc, and optionally meta-security.

bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-rauc

Add a RAUC bundle recipe and keypair

You'll need to define:

    a rauc-bundle.bb recipe

    certificates/keys in recipes-support/rauc/files/

And in your machine‚Äôs image recipe, add:

RAUC_KEY_FILE = "file://cert.pem"
RAUC_CERT_FILE = "file://cert.pem"

üß© 2. appfs Partition

You need to customize the partition layout via WIC (or legacy IMAGE_BOOT_FILES if you're not using WIC).
Step-by-step:
a. Create a WIC file (e.g. my-image.wks)

part /boot --source bootimg-partition --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=vfat --label boot --active --align 4
part / --source rootfs --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=ext4 --label rootfs --align 4
part /appfs --source rootfs --fstype=ext4 --label appfs --size 256 --ondisk mmcblk0 --align 4

You can also use --source rawcopy for a blank or pre-populated partition.
b. In local.conf:

IMAGE_FSTYPES += "wic"
WKS_FILE = "my-image.wks"

c. Add fstab entries (or use systemd mount units)

If you're using systemd, create a mount unit:

# appfs.mount
[Unit]
Description=Mount appfs partition
After=local-fs.target

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-label/appfs
Where=/appfs
Type=ext4
Options=defaults

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Then install that file from a recipe or via IMAGE_INSTALL.
üß© 3. Populate appfs with Apps

You have two main options:

    Blank Partition ‚Äî apps are updated externally (e.g. downloaded by the system).

    Pre-populated ‚Äî use a ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND to copy files from your build.

For example:

do_image_append() {
    mkdir -p ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/appfs
    install -m 0755 ${THISDIR}/files/myapp ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/appfs/
}

Or you could build a separate appfs image and reference it with --source rawcopy.
üß© 4. RAUC and appfs Interaction

You usually do not include appfs in the RAUC bundle, unless you want to manage it with updates.

If you do want that, create a new slot in the RAUC manifest:

"appfs": {
    "device": "/dev/mmcblk0p3",
    "type": "raw",
    "bootname": "appfs"
}

And generate/apply the bundle accordingly.
‚úÖ Summary
Component	Setup Step
RAUC Support	Add meta-rauc, set keys, enable in image
Custom Partition	WIC .wks file + systemd mount or /etc/fstab
Apps in appfs	Blank or pre-filled via image post-processing or rawcopy
RAUC + appfs	Optionally include in RAUC manifest as a dedicated slot

If you‚Äôd like, I can:

    generate a WKS file for you,

    create the mount unit,

    or help configure RAUC manifest files.

Just let me know where you're at or what parts you‚Äôd like help with.
You said:
i  generated  a toolchain to compile the apps and i want to use them from appfs
ChatGPT said:

Could you share more detail on how you plan to use the toolchain and apps in the appfs partition? For example:

    Are the apps compiled on your development PC using the toolchain, and then copied to the appfs partition?

    Should the Yocto image include a pre-populated appfs partition with the apps, or will it remain empty and apps be added later (e.g. OTA or SCP)?

    Are the apps dynamically linked (do they need runtime libraries from the image), or are they fully static?

    Should appfs be mounted at boot, and do you want apps from there to be added to $PATH automatically?

Once I know a bit more, I can guide you precisely on how to integrate and use the compiled apps from appfs.
You said:
the apps compiled on my development PC using the toolchain, and then copied to the appfs partition
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî thanks for clarifying!

So your flow is:

    ‚úÖ Apps are cross-compiled on your dev PC using the Yocto-generated toolchain.

    ‚úÖ You copy these apps manually (or via script) into the appfs partition.

    üîú You want the target system (PhyGATE-Tauri S) to mount appfs at boot and run apps from there.

Let‚Äôs walk through how to mount and use those apps cleanly from appfs.
‚úÖ 1. Cross-Compiling Your Apps (recap)

You‚Äôve likely done something like this:

source /opt/poky/2.6.4/environment-setup-armv7at2hf-neon-phyboard-tauris
arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o myapp myapp.c

That produces an executable (myapp) for the target.
üì¶ 2. Pre-Fill the appfs Partition

There are 3 ways to get your apps onto appfs:
Option A ‚Äì Manually copy (SD card or NFS mount):

    Format the appfs partition as ext4.

    Mount it:

mount /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt

Copy apps:

    cp myapp /mnt/

Option B ‚Äì Automatically include your apps into the appfs during image build:

    Create a recipe like myapps.bb to install compiled apps into a folder like ${D}/appfs/

    Use --source rawcopy in WIC to include that folder in the partition.

Option C ‚Äì Scripted after first boot:

    Create a post-install or provisioning script that populates appfs from a USB or over the network.

Let me know if you want help with any of these.
üìÇ 3. Mount appfs at Boot

You can mount it cleanly using systemd (recommended) or /etc/fstab.
Option A ‚Äì Systemd Mount Unit

Create a unit file appfs.mount:

[Unit]
Description=Mount appfs partition
After=local-fs.target

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-label/appfs
Where=/appfs
Type=ext4
Options=defaults

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Place it in:

/etc/systemd/system/appfs.mount

Then run:

systemctl enable appfs.mount

Option B ‚Äì fstab entry

In /etc/fstab, add:

/dev/disk/by-label/appfs  /appfs  ext4  defaults  0  2

‚öôÔ∏è 4. Run Apps from appfs

Let‚Äôs say you copied /appfs/myapp.
Option A ‚Äì Run directly:

/appfs/myapp

Option B ‚Äì Add to $PATH dynamically

Create a file like /etc/profile.d/appfs.sh:

#!/bin/sh
export PATH=$PATH:/appfs

Or if you're using systemd-based shells, you can set DefaultEnvironment= in a systemd drop-in.
‚úÖ Summary
Task	Setup
Compile apps	Use Yocto SDK or external toolchain
Copy to appfs	Manually (via SD/NFS), auto in image (via rawcopy), or OTA
Mount appfs	Use systemd unit or /etc/fstab
Use apps	Run with full path or add /appfs to $PATH

Would you like me to:

    Write a ready-to-use WIC file with appfs support?

    Provide a sample systemd .mount unit and recipe to install it?

    Or help create a Yocto recipe to bundle your apps into appfs?

Just let me know how far you'd like to automate this.
You said:
Yocto image include a pre-populated appfs partition with the apps
ChatGPT said:

Awesome ‚Äî so you want your Yocto-built image to include a pre-populated appfs partition with your cross-compiled apps already inside it.

Let‚Äôs do this properly with WIC + rawcopy and a custom Yocto recipe to collect the apps during image build.
‚úÖ Final Goal

You‚Äôll end up with:

    A *.wic image with 3 partitions: boot, rootfs, and appfs.

    appfs (label: appfs) contains your apps like /myapp, /mydaemon, etc.

    At runtime, the target mounts /dev/disk/by-label/appfs at /appfs, and apps are ready.

üß© STEP 1 ‚Äî Create a Directory to Hold the App Files

Create a Yocto recipe, say in recipes-apps/myapps/myapps.bb:

SUMMARY = "My precompiled apps to go into appfs"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"
SRC_URI = "file://myapp \
           file://mydaemon"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}/appfs
    install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/myapp ${D}/appfs/
    install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/mydaemon ${D}/appfs/
}

FILES:${PN} = "/appfs"

üìù Place your precompiled binaries in recipes-apps/myapps/files/.

Then add the layer if needed:

bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-myapps

üß© STEP 2 ‚Äî Create a Separate appfs Image

You need to define a custom image recipe that builds only the content of appfs, for example:

Create recipes-core/images/appfs-image.bb:

DESCRIPTION = "Image containing only appfs apps"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"

inherit core-image

IMAGE_INSTALL = "myapps"
IMAGE_LINGUAS = ""

IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE = "8192"
IMAGE_FSTYPES = "ext4"

Build it like this:

bitbake appfs-image

This gives you: tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/appfs-image-<machine>.ext4
üß© STEP 3 ‚Äî Use a Custom WKS File with rawcopy

Create a custom .wks file, e.g. myimage.wks:

part /boot --source bootimg-partition --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=vfat --label boot --active --align 4
part / --source rootfs --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=ext4 --label rootfs --align 4
part /appfs --source rawcopy --ondisk mmcblk0 --label appfs --align 4 --sourceparams="file=appfs-image.ext4"

üìå Important:

    The --source rawcopy tells Yocto to inject an existing .ext4 into the partition.

    You must place appfs-image.ext4 in the same directory where WIC looks (DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE).

üß© STEP 4 ‚Äî Modify local.conf to Use the Custom .wks

In your conf/local.conf:

WKS_FILE = "myimage.wks"
IMAGE_FSTYPES:append = " wic"

üß© STEP 5 ‚Äî Mount appfs at Boot (Systemd)

Use a systemd mount unit:

Create a file: recipes-core/base-files/appfs-mount.bbappend

FILESEXTRAPATHS:prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"

SRC_URI += "file://appfs.mount"

do_install:append() {
    install -Dm 0644 ${WORKDIR}/appfs.mount ${D}${systemd_system_unitdir}/appfs.mount
}

SYSTEMD_SERVICE:${PN} = "appfs.mount"
inherit systemd

Inside files/appfs.mount:

[Unit]
Description=Mount appfs partition
After=local-fs.target

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-label/appfs
Where=/appfs
Type=ext4
Options=defaults

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

‚úÖ At the End

You‚Äôll be able to:

    Boot your PhyGATE-Tauri S.

    /appfs will be mounted.

    Precompiled apps from your dev PC (bundled during Yocto build) will already be there.

Want Me to Generate Sample Files?

Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to:

    Generate myapps.bb, appfs-image.bb, and myimage.wks as ready-to-copy files.

    Write a shell script to copy your compiled apps into the Yocto build directory before bitbake.

    Help with systemd services or launchers for your apps inside /appfs.

Just say the word!
You said:
i have RAUC_SLOT_appfs no image defined
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôre almost there! That error:

    RAUC_SLOT_appfs: no image defined

‚Ä¶means that RAUC is configured to expect an image for a slot named appfs, but you haven‚Äôt yet told Yocto what image to use for that slot.

Let‚Äôs fix that by:
‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Define RAUC_SLOT_appfs
üß© 1. Build a Yocto image for appfs

Let‚Äôs assume you already created a minimal image for your apps, like this:

appfs-image

This will produce something like:

tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/appfs-image-<machine>.ext4

üß© 2. Define the RAUC slot appfs in local.conf or image.bb

Add this to your local.conf, distro.conf, or inside your main image .bb file:

RAUC_SLOT_appfs = "appfs-image"

This line tells Yocto + RAUC:

    For the appfs slot, use the output of the appfs-image BitBake target.

‚úÖ This resolves the "no image defined" error.
üß© 3. Declare the slot in your RAUC bundle recipe (*.raucb)

Your bundle.bb file should look like this (simplified):

require recipes-support/rauc/rauc.inc

RAUC_BUNDLE_SLOTS = "rootfs appfs"
RAUC_SLOT_rootfs = "core-image-minimal"
RAUC_SLOT_appfs = "appfs-image"

# Optional if you want to include boot too
RAUC_SLOT_boot = "bootfs-image" 

Then in your manifest.json (included in the RAUC bundle), declare the slots:

{
  "compatible": "phyboard-tauri",
  "version": "v2025.04",
  "slots": {
    "rootfs": {
      "device": "/dev/mmcblk0p2",
      "type": "ext4"
    },
    "appfs": {
      "device": "/dev/mmcblk0p3",
      "type": "ext4"
    }
  }
}

Make sure appfs is also defined in your .wks partition layout.
üß© 4. Build Your RAUC Bundle

bitbake rauc-bundle

Now RAUC will include the appfs-image.ext4 in the bundle, and you can update it alongside rootfs (or independently depending on your setup).
‚úÖ Summary
What you want	What to do
Fix RAUC_SLOT_appfs error	Add RAUC_SLOT_appfs = "appfs-image" in config
Use image for appfs	Create appfs-image.bb to generate a .ext4
Include in bundle	Add appfs to RAUC_BUNDLE_SLOTS in your recipe
Manifest slot info	Define appfs device and type in manifest.json

If you want, I can:

    Write a working appfs-image.bb file for your apps,

    Provide an example manifest.json,

    Or show how to update only appfs via RAUC.

Just say the word!
You said:
ive me a complte appfs-image
ChatGPT said:

Great! Here's a complete and ready-to-use appfs-image.bb recipe for your Yocto project. This recipe will:

    Create an ext4 image.

    Pre-populate it with your precompiled apps (from a recipe like myapps).

    Be usable in your RAUC appfs slot and your .wic layout with --source rawcopy.

‚úÖ recipes-core/images/appfs-image.bb

SUMMARY = "Image containing user applications to be deployed to appfs partition"
DESCRIPTION = "This image contains precompiled user-space applications, installed to be mounted under /appfs"
LICENSE = "MIT"
IMAGE_INSTALL = "myapps"  # Replace with your real app recipe
IMAGE_LINGUAS = ""

inherit core-image

# We just want the ext4 image, nothing else
IMAGE_FSTYPES = "ext4"

# Optional: define the rootfs size explicitly (in KB)
IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE = "65536"  # 64MB for example

# Disable init system and other default rootfs settings
IMAGE_FEATURES = ""
DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = "x11 wayland"
PACKAGE_INSTALL = "${IMAGE_INSTALL}"

# Reduce overhead
IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE = "0"
IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR = "1.0"

‚úÖ myapps.bb example (minimal recipe)

In recipes-apps/myapps/myapps.bb, assuming you've cross-compiled your apps and placed them in files/:

SUMMARY = "My precompiled apps to go into appfs"
LICENSE = "CLOSED"
SRC_URI = "file://myapp \
           file://mydaemon"

S = "${WORKDIR}"

do_install() {
    install -d ${D}/app
    install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/myapp ${D}/app/
    install -m 0755 ${WORKDIR}/mydaemon ${D}/app/
}

FILES:${PN} = "/app"

üìù That will result in /app/myapp and /app/mydaemon inside the appfs-image.ext4.
‚úÖ Use in RAUC and WIC

    RAUC slot setup:

RAUC_BUNDLE_SLOTS = "rootfs appfs"
RAUC_SLOT_appfs = "appfs-image"

    WIC layout (example myimage.wks):

part /boot --source bootimg-partition --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=vfat --label boot --active --align 4
part / --source rootfs --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=ext4 --label rootfs --align 4
part /appfs --source rawcopy --ondisk mmcblk0 --label appfs --align 4 --sourceparams="file=appfs-image.ext4"

‚úÖ Build

To build the appfs partition:

bitbake appfs-image

You‚Äôll get:

tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/appfs-image-<machine>.ext4

‚úÖ Mount on target

Mount the partition on target automatically with a systemd mount unit (as mentioned earlier), or:

mount /dev/disk/by-label/appfs /appfs

And your apps will be ready to run under /appfs.

Would you like me to:

    Generate a systemd .mount unit recipe for /appfs?

    Help you integrate this into a RAUC bundle?

    Create a wic layout that uses this image?

Just tell me what part you‚Äôd like next!
You said:
 integrate this into a RAUC bundle?
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs integrate your appfs-image into a RAUC bundle, so that it‚Äôs OTA-updatable just like rootfs.
‚úÖ GOAL

You‚Äôll have a *.raucb bundle that includes:

    ‚úÖ rootfs-image.ext4 (for the root partition)

    ‚úÖ appfs-image.ext4 (for the appfs partition)

    ‚úÖ A manifest (manifest.json) that RAUC uses to flash the images to the correct partitions

üß© STEP 1 ‚Äî Define RAUC slots in your bundle recipe

Assuming your RAUC bundle recipe is in something like:
recipes-support/rauc/phyboard-bundle.bb

Here‚Äôs the complete working example:

SUMMARY = "RAUC bundle for PhyGATE-Tauri with rootfs and appfs"
LICENSE = "MIT"

inherit rauc-bundle

RAUC_BUNDLE_COMPATIBLE = "phyboard-tauri"
RAUC_BUNDLE_VERSION = "v2025.04"

RAUC_BUNDLE_SLOTS = "rootfs appfs"
RAUC_SLOT_rootfs = "core-image-minimal"   # or your real rootfs image
RAUC_SLOT_appfs = "appfs-image"

# This is optional ‚Äî use if you include keys for signing
RAUC_KEY_FILE = "file://cert.pem"
RAUC_CERT_FILE = "file://cert.pem"

‚úÖ This tells Yocto: include both images, and sign if certs are available.
üß© STEP 2 ‚Äî Create your manifest.json

Put this in recipes-support/rauc/files/manifest.json:

{
  "version": "v2025.04",
  "compatible": "phyboard-tauri",
  "build": "yocto-bundle",
  "slots": {
    "rootfs": {
      "device": "/dev/mmcblk0p2",
      "type": "ext4"
    },
    "appfs": {
      "device": "/dev/mmcblk0p3",
      "type": "ext4"
    }
  }
}

‚úÖ This maps each image to the correct partition on your device.

If you are doing A/B updates, the slot names will change (like rootfs.0, appfs.0, etc.), but this works for single-slot setups.
üß© STEP 3 ‚Äî Add the files to your SRC_URI

In your phyboard-bundle.bb, add:

SRC_URI += "file://manifest.json"

Make sure it‚Äôs in the right files/ path relative to the recipe.
üß© STEP 4 ‚Äî Build the RAUC bundle

bitbake phyboard-bundle

Output:

tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/phyboard-bundle-<machine>.raucb

‚úÖ You can now flash or deploy this bundle via RAUC:

rauc install /mnt/usb/phyboard-bundle.raucb

Or over the network via RAUC service (e.g. D-Bus or shell integration).
üß© STEP 5 ‚Äî Ensure Partitions Exist and Are Labeled

Your .wic file must define and label both partitions correctly:

part / --source rootfs --ondisk mmcblk0 --fstype=ext4 --label rootfs --align 4
part /appfs --source rawcopy --ondisk mmcblk0 --label appfs --align 4 --sourceparams="file=appfs-image.ext4"

If the RAUC bundle is deployed but the label doesn‚Äôt match, it won‚Äôt work.
‚úÖ Summary of What You Need
Item	Required?	Example
appfs-image.bb	‚úÖ	Installs apps into /app
RAUC_SLOT_appfs	‚úÖ	RAUC_SLOT_appfs = "appfs-image"
RAUC_BUNDLE_SLOTS	‚úÖ	"rootfs appfs"
manifest.json	‚úÖ	Maps slot names to /dev/mmcblk0pX
.wic partition labels	‚úÖ	Must use --label appfs
rauc install	‚úÖ	Installs .raucb bundle on target

Would you like me to:

    Generate a real working phyboard-bundle.bb file for you?

    Include certificate signing setup?

    Provide a test script to validate that appfs updated correctly after RAUC install?

Let me know how far you'd like to go!
