It sounds like your board is booting, but the login process is failing. This could be caused by a variety of issues, including:
Possible Issues & Solutions
1. Check the Boot Arguments

    The kernel might not be pointing to the correct root filesystem.
    Run this command in U-Boot (if you have access):

    printenv

    Look for bootargs, and ensure the root= parameter is set to the correct partition where your Yocto rootfs is located.

Example:

root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait console=ttyS0,115200

    If it‚Äôs incorrect, update it:

    setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait console=ttyS0,115200'
    saveenv

2. Verify the Root Filesystem Structure

    Check if your Yocto rootfs is correctly populated.
    If possible, mount the partition on another system and inspect:

    ls /mnt/rootfs

    It should contain standard Linux directories like /bin, /sbin, /lib, /etc, etc.
    If it‚Äôs empty or incomplete, your Yocto rootfs might not have been properly installed.

3. Check Login Mechanism

    The getty service should be running for login.
    Try booting in single-user mode:
        In U-Boot, modify the kernel command line:

        setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw init=/bin/sh'
        boot

        If you get a shell, then your login system (e.g., PAM, shadow passwords) might be misconfigured.

4. Ensure Correct Permissions on /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow

    If you can access the rootfs, check:

ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow

Expected permissions:

    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root /etc/passwd
    -rw------- 1 root root /etc/shadow

    If they are missing or incorrect, recreate them.

5. Check Kernel Compatibility with Rootfs

    If you are using the Moxa FIT image‚Äôs kernel and a Yocto rootfs, there might be incompatibilities.
    Try using a Yocto-built kernel with matching modules.

6. Inspect Logs

    If you get to a console but login still fails, check logs:

    dmesg | grep -i error
    journalctl -xb

Next Steps

If none of these work, can you provide:

    The U-Boot logs
    The kernel boot log (dmesg)
    The error message when you try to login?

This will help diagnose the exact issue.

there is no error when i login just the credentials are wrong and ieven added a new user via et shadow and passwd the same just it tell me warging poky ?
ChatGPT said:

If you're seeing "Warning: poky" when trying to log in and your credentials are being rejected despite modifying /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, the issue could be related to Yocto's security mechanisms, PAM authentication, or shadow file mismatches. Let's troubleshoot systematically.
Step 1: Check Root User Authentication

Try logging in as root without a password:

root

    If it lets you in, your system might be configured for passwordless root login.
    If it asks for a password but denies it, your /etc/shadow file might not be in sync.

Step 2: Reset Passwords from U-Boot (Single-User Mode)

If you have access to U-Boot, boot into single-user mode:

    Interrupt U-Boot and modify the kernel boot arguments:

setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw init=/bin/sh'
boot

Once the system boots, remount the filesystem as read-write:

mount -o remount,rw /

Change the root password:

passwd

Restart:

    exec /sbin/init

Try logging in again.
Step 3: Verify /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd

Check their permissions:

ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow

Expected:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  /etc/passwd
-rw------- 1 root root  /etc/shadow

If incorrect:

chmod 644 /etc/passwd
chmod 600 /etc/shadow

If you manually edited /etc/shadow, ensure the hash format is correct. You can reset a password by setting it to a known hash:

openssl passwd -6 'newpassword'

Then replace the root password field in /etc/shadow with the generated hash.
Step 4: Disable PAM Temporarily

If PAM is causing issues, you can disable it:

    Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf and change:

passwd: compat
shadow: compat

To:

passwd: files
shadow: files

Remove PAM authentication (for debugging):

    mv /etc/pam.d /etc/pam.d.bak

    Reboot and try logging in again.

Step 5: Check System Logs

If the login prompt keeps rejecting credentials, check:

cat /var/log/auth.log
journalctl -xe

Look for authentication-related errors.
Step 6: Test with Another RootFS

Try using another Yocto-based root filesystem (from core-image-minimal or core-image-full-cmdline) to see if it‚Äôs a problem with your current rootfs setup.
Next Steps

If login still fails, let me know:

    What image recipe you used to build the rootfs?
    What exact steps you took to modify /etc/shadow?
    The exact message shown when login is rejected.

You said:
i used machine=am64xx-evm
ChatGPT said:

Since you used MACHINE=am64xx-evm, you are working with TI AM64xx-based boards using Yocto. Here‚Äôs how to troubleshoot your login issue:
Step 1: Check Default Yocto Credentials

Before anything, try logging in with the default credentials for Poky-based Yocto images:

    Username: root
    Password: (press Enter) ‚Üí Many Yocto images allow root login without a password.

If this works, your image has no password set, and you can configure users after login.
Step 2: Check /etc/shadow Hash Format

Since you manually modified /etc/shadow, check if the password hash is in a valid format.

Run:

cat /etc/shadow | grep root

Expected format:

root:$6$abc123...:19000:0:99999:7:::

    If root has ! or *, authentication is disabled:

root:!:19000:0:99999:7:::

Fix it by generating a new password hash:

    openssl passwd -6 'yourpassword'

    Replace the root password in /etc/shadow with this hash.

Step 3: Boot into Single-User Mode

If login still fails, reset the password manually.

    Interrupt U-Boot and enter bootargs:

setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw init=/bin/sh'
boot

Remount rootfs as read-write:

mount -o remount,rw /

Set a new password:

passwd root

Reboot:

    exec /sbin/init

Try logging in again.
Step 4: Verify NSS and PAM Configuration

Yocto-based systems sometimes have strict NSS/PAM settings. Check /etc/nsswitch.conf:

cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep passwd

Expected:

passwd: files
shadow: files

If it shows compat, change it to files.

Disable PAM (for debugging):

mv /etc/pam.d /etc/pam.d.bak

Reboot and try logging in.
Step 5: Check Kernel Boot Logs

If it still fails, check the logs:

journalctl -xe
dmesg | grep -i error

Look for:

    authentication failure
    /etc/shadow file corruption
    PAM errors

Step 6: Test a Minimal RootFS

If nothing works, try booting a known-good rootfs:

    Download a reference rootfs for am64xx-evm:

    wget https://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/AM64X/latest/exports/tisdk-default-image-am64xx-evm.tar.xz

    Extract it to your rootfs partition and reboot.

Next Steps

If login still fails, provide:

    The exact message when login is rejected.
    Output of:

    ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
    cat /etc/shadow | grep root
    journalctl -xe | tail -20

This will help pinpoint the issue. üöÄ

ChatGPT said:

If the only message you see is "Warning: poky" when attempting to log in, and your credentials are being rejected despite manually modifying /etc/shadow, this suggests a few possible causes:
üîç Possible Issues and Fixes
‚úÖ Step 1: Try Logging in Without a Password

Since you are using a Yocto-based system (Poky), some images allow password-less login. Try:

root

(Just press Enter without typing a password)

If this works, your image is set up to allow password-less root login, and you can configure a password later.
‚úÖ Step 2: Boot Into Single-User Mode and Reset Password

If login fails, reset the password by booting into single-user mode.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Interrupt U-Boot during startup
(Press a key when you see the U-Boot prompt)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the kernel boot arguments:

setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw init=/bin/sh'
boot

3Ô∏è‚É£ Remount the root filesystem as read/write:

mount -o remount,rw /

4Ô∏è‚É£ Reset the root password:

passwd root

Enter a new password twice.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Restart:

exec /sbin/init

Now, try logging in with the new password.
‚úÖ Step 3: Check /etc/shadow for Corruption

If login still fails, check /etc/shadow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Boot into single-user mode (Step 2).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run:

cat /etc/shadow | grep root

Expected format:

root:$6$abc123...:19000:0:99999:7:::

    If you see ! or *, authentication is disabled:

root:!:19000:0:99999:7:::

Fix it by setting a new password:

    openssl passwd -6 'yourpassword'

    Replace the root password field in /etc/shadow with the output.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check file permissions:

ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow

Expected:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  /etc/passwd
-rw------- 1 root root  /etc/shadow

If permissions are incorrect:

chmod 644 /etc/passwd
chmod 600 /etc/shadow

4Ô∏è‚É£ Reboot and test login.
‚úÖ Step 4: Check PAM and NSS Configuration

If login is still failing:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check NSS configuration:

cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep passwd

Expected:

passwd: files
shadow: files

    If it says compat, change it to files.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Temporarily disable PAM (for debugging):

mv /etc/pam.d /etc/pam.d.bak

Reboot and try logging in again.

is there other solution
ChatGPT said:

Yes! Since you‚Äôre seeing "Warning: poky" and login is failing, but there are no kernel errors, here are alternative solutions beyond resetting passwords.
üîé Alternative Solutions for Yocto Login Issue
‚úÖ Solution 1: Switch to a Different Console

Sometimes, Yocto images boot into the wrong console. Try switching terminals:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check available terminals:
Press Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6 to cycle through available TTYs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If you see a login prompt on another terminal, try logging in with:

root

(Press Enter if no password is required)
‚úÖ Solution 2: Force Console on Serial (for Debugging)

If you're using a serial console, try specifying it in U-Boot:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Interrupt U-Boot

    Press a key during boot.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set correct console device (example for AM64xx-EVM):

setenv bootargs 'console=ttyS2,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait'
saveenv
boot

3Ô∏è‚É£ Try logging in again.
‚úÖ Solution 3: Manually Start getty Service

Yocto systems rely on getty for login. If it's not running, you can't log in.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Boot into single-user mode (see previous steps).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check if getty is running:

ps aux | grep getty

    If no getty process appears, start it manually:

/sbin/getty -L 115200 ttyS2 vt100

If this works, enable it permanently:

    systemctl enable serial-getty@ttyS2.service
    reboot

‚úÖ Solution 4: Fix inittab (SysV Init)

If getty isn‚Äôt running, inittab might be misconfigured.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Boot into single-user mode.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Check /etc/inittab:

cat /etc/inittab

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure there‚Äôs a line like:

S2:12345:respawn:/sbin/getty -L 115200 ttyS2 vt100

4Ô∏è‚É£ Save and reboot.
‚úÖ Solution 5: Use a Debug Shell (emergency.target)

If login keeps failing, force the system into emergency mode to debug:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Reboot and interrupt U-Boot.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify kernel boot args:

setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw systemd.unit=emergency.target'
boot

3Ô∏è‚É£ This boots directly into a root shell.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fix login issues (check /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, etc.).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Reboot normally.
‚úÖ Solution 6: Reinstall shadow-utils

If password authentication is failing due to a missing/broken passwd utility:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Boot into single-user mode.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Reinstall shadow-utils:

opkg update
opkg install shadow

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reset the root password:

passwd root

4Ô∏è‚É£ Reboot.
üöÄ Final Steps

If none of these work, provide:

    Output of:

    ps aux | grep getty
    ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow
    cat /etc/inittab
    dmesg | grep -i error
    journalctl -xe | tail -20

    Exact login error message (besides "Warning: poky").

This will help pinpoint the issue! üöÄ
