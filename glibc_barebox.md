Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down step by step, because the difference between "Linux version of the kernel" and a "GNU/Linux version stripped of binaries" is subtle but important.
üîß 1. Linux Version (Kernel Only)

This refers specifically to the Linux kernel, which is:

    The core of the operating system.

    It handles hardware communication, process scheduling, memory management, file systems, etc.

    It is just a monolithic binary file, usually named vmlinuz or zImage, etc.

üß† Think of it as the engine of a car ‚Äî powerful, but not usable on its own.

Example:
Linux kernel 5.10.0 ‚Äî you can download and compile this, but it won‚Äôt boot into a usable OS by itself.
üì¶ 2. GNU/Linux Version Stripped of Binaries

This refers to a Linux distribution (like Debian, Ubuntu, or Yocto-based OS) that uses:

    The Linux kernel, AND

    A set of GNU tools and core user-space programs (like bash, cp, ls, init, etc.)

When you say "stripped of binaries", it likely means:

    The user-space applications and utilities have been removed.

    You might only have the kernel + a minimal root filesystem, with little to no commands/utilities.

    This is often used in embedded systems or container base images.

üß† This is like having the car engine plus the chassis but no seats, steering wheel, or dashboard ‚Äî it "boots", but you can‚Äôt do much.
üîç Summary
Term	Contains	Usability	Typical Use
Linux Kernel	Only the kernel binary	Not usable on its own	Embedded dev, OS bootloaders
GNU/Linux stripped of binaries	Kernel + minimal rootfs (no apps)	Barely usable, minimal OS	Base image for custom embedded OS
GNU/Linux full system	Kernel + GNU utils + apps	Fully usable OS	Desktops, servers, dev systems
üí° Example from Embedded Linux

In Yocto, for instance:

    You can build a minimal image with just the Linux kernel and BusyBox (or even less).

    If you remove even BusyBox, you get a system where you can boot to a shell (maybe), but can‚Äôt run commands like ls, cat, etc.

Would you like a demo or file structure example of each to visualize the difference more concretely?

no, i talk about this : ssh.openssh: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /usr/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1, BuildID[sha1]=ff4dfdd5d28fc42201efd2175185b54dbe820396, for GNU/Linux 5.15.0, stripped
ChatGPT said:

Ah, got it! You're referring to the file metadata of a binary ‚Äî specifically:

ssh.openssh: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /usr/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1, BuildID[sha1]=..., for GNU/Linux 5.15.0, stripped

Let‚Äôs break it down and address your question about the difference between the Linux version of the kernel and the "GNU/Linux version" that appears in this ELF header.
‚úÖ Key Terminology Breakdown
üß† "for GNU/Linux 5.15.0"

    This means the binary was compiled for a system:

        Using the GNU C Library (glibc) as its C runtime.

        Running the Linux kernel version 5.15.0 or compatible.

    It doesn't imply a full distro like Debian or Ubuntu ‚Äî just the ABI (Application Binary Interface) expectations:

        GNU = expecting glibc.

        Linux 5.15.0 = expects syscall and kernel ABI from at least that version.

So here, "GNU/Linux" is not about the distro, it's about:

    "This binary uses GNU userland (glibc), and needs at least kernel 5.15.0."

üîç What's the difference with "Linux version of the kernel"?

    Linux 5.15.0 is the kernel version, e.g., what uname -r would show.

    In the ELF metadata (for GNU/Linux 5.15.0), it's saying:

        "This binary is dynamically linked and was built to be ABI-compatible with systems running Linux 5.15.0 and glibc."

So:
Term	Meaning
Linux 5.15.0	The kernel version the binary expects for system calls & features
GNU/Linux 5.15.0 (in ELF)	The binary is for Linux 5.15.0, and expects glibc (GNU)
üì¶ What does "stripped" mean?

    "Stripped" = debug symbols (e.g. function names, variable names) have been removed to reduce binary size.

    You can‚Äôt easily reverse-engineer it or debug it with gdb unless you have the symbols separately.

üß™ Bonus: See for yourself

If you run:

file /usr/bin/ssh

You‚Äôll see similar output.

Or for more info:

readelf -h /usr/bin/ssh
readelf -d /usr/bin/ssh

You‚Äôll find details about the OS ABI, dynamic linker, and more.
‚úÖ TL;DR

    "Linux version of the kernel" = actual kernel version (e.g., 5.15.0).

    "for GNU/Linux 5.15.0" (in ELF) = the binary was compiled for glibc-based systems running kernel 5.15+.

    This is not about distributions like Ubuntu vs. Alpine ‚Äî it‚Äôs strictly about the expected runtime environment and ABI.

    "stripped" means the binary has no debug symbols (leaner, harder to debug).

Let me know if you want to dig into the readelf or objdump outputs to understand how that ABI requirement is encoded!

i want to build a rootfs with yocto for GNU/Linux 3.7, how to do it in detaills
ChatGPT said:

Great! Let‚Äôs walk through exactly how to build a rootfs for GNU/Linux 3.7 using Yocto, in full detail. This means:

    Building a minimal root filesystem (rootfs) that‚Äôs compatible with the Linux kernel 3.7.0.

    Using glibc as the C library, so binaries are for GNU/Linux 3.7.

    Possibly targeting an ARM or ARM64 architecture (you mentioned earlier AM64x, but Linux 3.7 is quite old).

‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Guide: Build a Yocto RootFS for GNU/Linux 3.7
üîß 1. Choose a Yocto Version Compatible with Kernel 3.7

Linux 3.7 was released in 2012, so you need a Yocto release from that era.

‚úÖ Use Yocto "Dylan" (v1.4), which supports kernels in the 3.4‚Äì3.8 range.

You can clone it like this:

git clone -b dylan git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky poky-dylan
cd poky-dylan

üìÅ 2. Add Your Target Machine Layer

If you're targeting a specific board (e.g. Moxa UC-1222A), you‚Äôll need to:

    Create a custom meta-layer, e.g., meta-moxa

    Add a machine.conf file that matches your hardware (we can help create this if you need).

You can also use the generic qemuarm or qemuarm64 machine to start:

source oe-init-build-env

Edit conf/local.conf:

MACHINE = "qemuarm"

Or for AArch64:

MACHINE = "qemuarm64"

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Set the Kernel Version to 3.7.0

You'll need to force the kernel version to 3.7.0 in your custom layer.
A. Create a layer:

bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-custom
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-custom

B. Add kernel recipe override

Create a kernel recipe in meta-custom/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-custom_3.7.0.bb:

DESCRIPTION = "Linux kernel 3.7.0 custom build"
LICENSE = "GPLv2"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=..."

SRC_URI = "http://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.7.tar.xz"

S = "${WORKDIR}/linux-3.7"

inherit kernel

# Optionally apply patches
# SRC_URI += "file://patch-name.patch"

# Set custom defconfig
# FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/linux-custom:"
# SRC_URI += "file://your_defconfig"

Then add a PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel in conf/local.conf or conf/layer.conf:

PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-custom"
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-custom = "3.7.0"

üß± 4. Build a Minimal RootFS with glibc

Edit conf/local.conf to build a minimal image:

DISTRO = "poky"
MACHINE = "qemuarm"  # or your board
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "ext4"

# Ensure we're using glibc
TCLIBC = "glibc"

Use a small base image like:

bitbake core-image-minimal

This will create:

tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm/core-image-minimal-qemuarm.ext4
tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm/zImage

You now have:

    ‚úÖ A rootfs built for GNU/Linux

    ‚úÖ A kernel version 3.7.0

    ‚úÖ All binaries dynamically linked against glibc

    ‚úÖ The binaries will show for GNU/Linux 3.7.0 in file output

üìÇ 5. Optional: Check the Output ELF Binary

To check the ABI compatibility:

file tmp/work/qemuarm-poky-linux-gnueabi/busybox/1.20.2-r0/packages-split/busybox/usr/bin/ls

Output will be like:

ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 3.7.0, stripped

Perfect. ‚úÖ
üß™ 6. Boot It (Optional Testing with QEMU)

If you're using qemuarm:

runqemu qemuarm core-image-minimal

üß† Summary
Step	Action
1Ô∏è‚É£	Use Yocto Dylan (or similar old version)
2Ô∏è‚É£	Define your machine or use qemuarm
3Ô∏è‚É£	Create linux-custom_3.7.0.bb to fetch and build kernel 3.7.0
4Ô∏è‚É£	Build core-image-minimal with glibc
5Ô∏è‚É£	You get binaries for GNU/Linux 3.7
6Ô∏è‚É£	Test via QEMU or on real hardware

Would you like:

    A full example meta-custom layer for Linux 3.7?

You said:
when i built an image with kernel version 6.6 the version of GNU/Linux binary was 5.15 how to control that
ChatGPT said:

Ahh, that‚Äôs a great observation ‚Äî and it's a common source of confusion in embedded Linux builds. Let‚Äôs clarify what's happening and how to control the "for GNU/Linux X.Y" version seen in ELF binaries.
üîç Problem Recap

You built a Yocto image with Linux kernel 6.6, but when you inspect your binaries (e.g. with file busybox), it says:

ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, dynamically linked, for GNU/Linux 5.15.0, stripped

So the binary is not marked for 6.6, but for 5.15. Why?
üß† Why This Happens

The for GNU/Linux X.Y.Z string in a binary does not come from the running kernel or even your kernel build ‚Äî it comes from the toolchain, specifically:

    The C library (glibc) used at build time.

    The compiler (gcc) and linker (ld) target settings.

    The --enable-kernel=5.15.0 flag passed during glibc configuration.

    ‚úÖ In Yocto, the glibc version and its --enable-kernel setting defines the minimum kernel version your binaries are compatible with.

‚úÖ How to Control the "for GNU/Linux X.Y" String

To make your binaries say "for GNU/Linux 6.6", you must rebuild glibc with:

--enable-kernel=6.6.0

This changes the glibc ABI to assume the presence of features only available in Linux 6.6+.
üîß Steps to Set This in Yocto

    Create a local bbappend for glibc
    Create the file:

meta-yourlayer/recipes-core/glibc/glibc_%.bbappend

    Set the kernel compatibility version
    Inside the .bbappend, add:

EXTRA_OECONF_append = " --enable-kernel=6.6.0"

    Clean and rebuild glibc and all affected packages

bitbake -c cleansstate glibc
bitbake core-image-minimal

Now when you run:

file /bin/ls

You should see:

ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, dynamically linked, for GNU/Linux 6.6.0, stripped

Boom ‚úÖ
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

    Be careful: using a high --enable-kernel removes backward compatibility with older kernels. Your binaries will not run on kernels older than 6.6.0.

    If you only want to build with kernel 6.6 but still support older kernels (e.g. 5.10 or 5.15), leave --enable-kernel to the older version.

    You can check glibc‚Äôs current config with:

bitbake -e glibc | grep enable-kernel

üß™ Bonus: See It in Action

$ file /bin/ls
ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 6.6.0, stripped

This confirms your binaries were compiled with a toolchain that assumes Linux 6.6 ABI.
üß† TL;DR
You Want to Control This	Do This in Yocto
for GNU/Linux X.Y in ELF	Set --enable-kernel=X.Y when building glibc
Kernel version used at boot	Controlled by your virtual/kernel (unrelated to above)
Match both	Build glibc with --enable-kernel=X.Y and use kernel X.Y

Would you like me to generate a full .bbappend file for glibc targeting 6.6, or do you want to inspect the current setting in your build system?
You said:
but is the version og glibc dependent of yocto version ?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, the version of glibc is indeed dependent on the Yocto version (a.k.a. Poky release) ‚Äî and that‚Äôs an important constraint to understand when building custom root filesystems.

Let me explain exactly how and why that matters, and what you can do about it.
üß† 1. How Yocto Chooses glibc Version

Each Yocto release (e.g., Dunfell, Hardknott, Kirkstone, Scarthgap) pins a specific glibc version to ensure compatibility, reproducibility, and stability.

For example:
Yocto Version	Glibc Version	Kernel Compatible
Dunfell (3.1)	glibc 2.31	kernel 4.14‚Äì5.4
Hardknott (3.3)	glibc 2.33	kernel 4.19‚Äì5.10
Kirkstone (4.0)	glibc 2.35	kernel 5.10‚Äì5.15
Scarthgap (5.0)	glibc 2.39	kernel 5.15‚Äì6.6

So yes ‚Äî when you use Yocto Dunfell, you're using glibc 2.31 by default.
üîç 2. Why It Matters

    The glibc version defines what system calls, symbols, and headers are available to user-space applications.

    Older Yocto releases ‚Üí older glibc ‚Üí fewer modern features.

    Newer glibc may refuse to build or run on older kernels unless patched.

    glibc‚Äôs --enable-kernel=K.V defines the minimum supported kernel version for that glibc build.

    You cannot just raise --enable-kernel arbitrarily on an old glibc version, or use a newer glibc in an older Yocto without patching things.

‚úÖ 3. How to Check glibc Version in Your Yocto Build

You can check what glibc version your Yocto release is using with:

bitbake -e glibc | grep ^PV=

Or inspect:

meta/recipes-core/glibc/glibc_*.bb

You‚Äôll see something like glibc_2.31.bb or glibc_2.35.bb.
üîß 4. Can You Change the glibc Version in Yocto?
‚úîÔ∏è YES, but with effort:

You can upgrade or downgrade glibc manually, but it‚Äôs tricky because:

    It can break ABI compatibility with other packages.

    Other recipes in Yocto (e.g. libgcc, systemd, util-linux) depend on glibc features.

    It may require patching eglibc.inc or glibc-common.inc.

You may also face:

    Build failures

    Runtime errors

    Incompatibility with kernel headers

So unless you have a strong reason, it's best to stick with the glibc version provided by your chosen Yocto release, and just tune the --enable-kernel flag for compatibility.
üß™ 5. What You Can Do Safely

If you want binaries to show:

for GNU/Linux 3.7.0

Without changing Yocto version or glibc version, just do:

# meta-yourlayer/recipes-core/glibc/glibc_%.bbappend
EXTRA_OECONF_append = " --enable-kernel=3.7.0"

Then rebuild glibc and your image:

bitbake -c cleansstate glibc
bitbake core-image-minimal

‚úÖ You‚Äôll now get binaries that say:

for GNU/Linux 3.7.0

Even though your actual kernel might be newer.
üß† Summary
Question	Answer
Is glibc version tied to Yocto?	‚úÖ Yes, each Yocto release pins a specific glibc version
Can you change glibc version?	‚ö†Ô∏è Yes, but it's complex and risky
Can you control for GNU/Linux?	‚úÖ Yes, via --enable-kernel=X.Y in glibc's configure options
Want support for Linux 3.7?	‚úÖ Use --enable-kernel=3.7.0, maybe stick to an older glibc (e.g. 2.31)

Would you like me to:

    Suggest the best Yocto version to build a rootfs fully compatible with Linux 3.7.0?

    Or help you patch a newer Yocto to downgrade --enable-kernel safely?

You said:
target system moxa uc1222A with kernel 5.10
ChatGPT said:

Perfect. Since your target system is the Moxa UC-1222A, and you've confirmed it uses Linux kernel 5.10, here's exactly how to configure your Yocto project to generate binaries for:

    for GNU/Linux 5.10.0

‚Ä¶which will match the kernel ABI of the UC-1222A, ensuring full compatibility with your rootfs.
‚úÖ Recap of What We Want

    Target device: Moxa UC-1222A

    CPU: TI AM64x (ARM64)

    Kernel: Linux 5.10 (RT patched)

    Goal: Build a glibc-based rootfs with binaries explicitly marked for GNU/Linux 5.10.0

üß± Recommended Yocto Version

To match kernel 5.10.x and glibc compatibility:

    ‚úÖ Use Yocto Dunfell (v3.1 LTS)

It provides:

    glibc 2.31 (supports setting --enable-kernel=5.10)

    Long Term Support until 2026

    Kernel recipes up to 5.10 (used by meta-ti for AM64x)

‚úÖ Steps to Control the "for GNU/Linux 5.10" in Yocto
üîß 1. Clone Yocto Dunfell

git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky poky-dunfell
cd poky-dunfell

üì¶ 2. Add Layers (e.g. meta-ti for AM64x)

git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-openembedded
git clone -b dunfell git://git.ti.com/git/meta-ti
source oe-init-build-env
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-ti

Make sure to select the proper machine:

# conf/local.conf
MACHINE = "am64xx-evm"

(Replace am64xx-evm with your actual UC-1222A-compatible machine config if needed.)
‚úèÔ∏è 3. Override glibc Configuration

Create a .bbappend to set --enable-kernel=5.10.0:

mkdir -p ../meta-moxa/recipes-core/glibc
touch ../meta-moxa/recipes-core/glibc/glibc_%.bbappend
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-moxa

Inside glibc_%.bbappend:

EXTRA_OECONF_append = " --enable-kernel=5.10.0"

This ensures that glibc compiles all user-space binaries assuming Linux 5.10 as the minimum kernel ABI.
üßº 4. Clean and Rebuild glibc

bitbake -c cleansstate glibc
bitbake core-image-minimal

‚úÖ 5. Verify It Worked

Once built, run:

file tmp/deploy/images/am64xx-evm/core-image-minimal-am64xx-evm.tar.gz

Or extract and check any binary, like:

file ./usr/bin/ls

Expected output:

ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, dynamically linked, for GNU/Linux 5.10.0, stripped

üéØ Perfectly ABI-compatible with Moxa UC-1222A!
‚ö†Ô∏è Tips

    If your actual kernel is older than 5.10, set --enable-kernel=5.4.0 or 5.10.0-rt depending on the actual features it supports.

    Using a higher version than your kernel = runtime crash risk.

    --enable-kernel=X.Y.Z doesn‚Äôt change the kernel itself, only glibc‚Äôs runtime assumptions.

üß† Summary
Task	What to Do
Match glibc to kernel	Use --enable-kernel=5.10.0 in glibc_%.bbappend
Match glibc version	Stick with Yocto Dunfell (glibc 2.31)
Match machine	Use am64xx-evm or custom machine for UC-1222A
Validate ELF binaries	Use file on binaries to check for for GNU/Linux 5.10.0

give me full detailled steps to build barebox bootloader for moxa uc1222A
ChatGPT said:

Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs go step-by-step to build the Barebox bootloader for the Moxa UC-1222A, which is based on the TI AM64x SoC (ARM64).

Since Moxa Industrial Linux 3 uses a TI AM64x platform, we can target Barebox support for AM64x (based on K3 family of TI SoCs). Although Moxa likely ships U-Boot by default, Barebox is a great alternative for custom secure, minimal, and scriptable bootloading.
‚úÖ GOAL

    üéØ Build Barebox for the TI AM64x SoC (used in UC-1222A).

    üéØ Output: a Barebox binary (e.g. barebox-am64xx.img) that you can flash on the UC-1222A boot media (SD/eMMC/flash).

    üéØ Optionally: customize device tree, environment, splash, etc.

üîß ASSUMPTIONS
Item	Value/Assumption
Target SoC	TI AM642x (part of AM64x family)
Board	Moxa UC-1222A
Barebox source	barebox.org or git:// mirror
Host PC	Ubuntu/Debian-based (cross-compilation)
Cross-compiler	aarch64-linux-gnu- toolchain
Kernel headers	Optional (for device tree validation)
üß± STEP 1 ‚Äì Install Dependencies

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git flex bison libncurses5-dev libssl-dev \
     u-boot-tools device-tree-compiler gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu

üìÅ STEP 2 ‚Äì Clone Barebox Source

Barebox officially supports TI K3 SoCs, including AM64x:

git clone https://git.pengutronix.de/git/barebox.git
cd barebox

    ‚úÖ Tip: You can check available boards using:

ls arch/arm/boards/

For AM64x, there‚Äôs:

arch/arm/boards/ti-am64x-evm/

This is our closest match to the UC-1222A. We‚Äôll base our build on it.
‚öôÔ∏è STEP 3 ‚Äì Select Configuration

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- ti-am64x-evm_defconfig

This will:

    Select the default config for AM64x.

    Enable support for SPL and DDR-init boot path.

    Match closely with Moxa's AM642.

    You can later customize with:

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig

üî® STEP 4 ‚Äì Build Barebox

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

Output:

    images/barebox-ti-am64x-evm.img ‚Äì the full bootloader

    images/barebox-ti-am64x-evm.dtb ‚Äì device tree used

    images/barebox.bin, barebox-spl.bin, etc.

üì§ STEP 5 ‚Äì Flashing / Deployment

This step depends on how your UC-1222A boots:
A. If via SD card (BOOT mode configured accordingly):

    Use dd to flash the image:

sudo dd if=images/barebox-ti-am64x-evm.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync

B. If via UART + ROM boot:

    Use k3-image-gen tools or TI's ROM boot tools to send SPL over UART

    Or integrate Barebox SPL+PBL into the TI boot image format

(Moxa boot process uses SPL + ATF ‚Äî if you want help mimicking this, I can provide a full boot chain.)
üß™ STEP 6 ‚Äì Serial Console Setup

Connect to UC-1222A via serial console:

screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

After boot, you should see Barebox prompt:

Welcome to barebox!
barebox@am64x:/

üß© STEP 7 ‚Äì Customizing for Moxa UC-1222A

The ti-am64x-evm_defconfig is generic for AM64x-EVM. To customize for Moxa UC-1222A:
‚úÖ A. Provide the correct Device Tree

If you can extract the DTB from the original Moxa image:

dtc -I dtb -O dts -o uc1222a.dts moxa-am642-uc1222a.dtb

Then place it in:

arch/arm/dts/

And reference it in:

arch/arm/boards/ti-am64x-evm/board.c

You may also create a new board directory, e.g. arch/arm/boards/moxa-uc1222a/.
üß† [Optional] STEP 8 ‚Äì Barebox as Secondary Bootloader

If UC-1222A uses a U-Boot SPL:

    You can use Barebox as a 2nd stage bootloader, loaded by U-Boot.

    You only need barebox.bin, and can boot it using bootm, or via extlinux.conf.

üîç STEP 9 ‚Äì Testing

Once booted:

help
printenv
ls /dev

You can also:

    Load kernel + rootfs from SD/eMMC/USB/network

    Boot your Yocto image with:

bootm /path/to/zImage /path/to/devicetree.dtb /path/to/rootfs

        Initializes SoC (DDR, UART, MMC, etc.)

        Loads and boots Linux kernel (zImage)

        Loads Device Tree (.dtb)

        Loads RootFS (either in RAM, or mounts from SD/USB/NFS)

    Linux Kernel:

        Starts with the right cmdline

        Mounts the root filesystem

    RootFS:

        Contains /init or /sbin/init or BusyBox

        Spawns a shell (e.g. /bin/sh or /bin/login)

üß± STEP 1 ‚Äì Build Barebox for UC-1222A

We covered this earlier, quick recap:

git clone https://git.pengutronix.de/git/barebox.git
cd barebox
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- ti-am64x-evm_defconfig
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

You‚Äôll get:
‚úÖ images/barebox-ti-am64x-evm.img

Flash this to SD or load over UART.
üßæ STEP 2 ‚Äì Prepare Kernel + DTB

Use a Linux 5.10.x kernel compatible with AM64x. Options:
Option A: Use Moxa‚Äôs kernel (already matched to board)

Extract it from their firmware:

binwalk -e moxa_image.bin
# Look for zImage, uImage, or Image

Option B: Use TI‚Äôs AM64x kernel source

git clone -b ti-linux-5.10.y git://git.ti.com/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel.git
cd ti-linux-kernel
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- tisdk_am64xx_defconfig
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- zImage dtbs

You‚Äôll get:

    arch/arm64/boot/zImage

    arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am642-evm.dtb (replace with Moxa DTB if available)

üì¶ STEP 3 ‚Äì Build Minimal RootFS (with Shell)

We want a Yocto rootfs with glibc and BusyBox, built for AM64x.

From your Yocto build:

bitbake core-image-minimal

Find your rootfs:

tmp/deploy/images/am64xx-evm/core-image-minimal-am64xx-evm.cpio.gz

This is an initramfs ‚Äî you can boot directly into it from Barebox.

Optional: Convert to initramfs.cpio.gz.uboot if needed.
üìÇ STEP 4 ‚Äì Organize Boot Files on SD or TFTP

Structure on SD card (FAT partition):

/barebox.bin
/zImage
/k3-am642-uc1222a.dtb
/initramfs.cpio.gz

üîß STEP 5 ‚Äì Barebox Script or Manual Boot

Connect over serial:

screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

At the Barebox shell:

mmc0.scan

load mmc0 zImage
load mmc0 k3-am642-uc1222a.dtb
load mmc0 initramfs.cpio.gz

bootz zImage k3-am642-uc1222a.dtb initramfs.cpio.gz

Or use script (create /env/init or use BootEntries):

#!/bin/sh
global.boot.default=autoboot

autoboot() {
    mmc0.scan
    load mmc0 zImage
    load mmc0 k3-am642-uc1222a.dtb
    load mmc0 initramfs.cpio.gz
    bootz zImage k3-am642-uc1222a.dtb initramfs.cpio.gz
}

üêß STEP 6 ‚Äì Kernel Command Line

Make sure the kernel gets proper command line, e.g.:

global.linux.bootargs.dyn.ip=off
global.linux.bootargs.base="console=ttyS2,115200 root=/dev/ram rw earlycon"

Instructs kernel to:

    Use serial port

    Boot from initramfs in RAM

    Run shell (BusyBox default)

üß™ STEP 7 ‚Äì You Should See...

If successful, you‚Äôll get:

Barebox 2023.x ...

ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî you want to build the entire boot chain using Yocto for the Moxa UC-1222A, including:

    ‚úÖ Barebox bootloader

    ‚úÖ Linux kernel (5.10.x)

    ‚úÖ Root filesystem with shell (initramfs or ext4)

    ‚úÖ All bootable and flashable from SD (or other media)

üß† WHAT YOU GET AT THE END

From your Yocto build, you'll generate:

    barebox.bin ‚Üí Bootloader

    zImage + am64xx.dtb ‚Üí Linux kernel + device tree

    core-image-minimal.cpio.gz or .ext4 ‚Üí Rootfs with BusyBox shell

    All wrapped in a consistent BSP (Board Support Package) targeting Moxa UC-1222A (based on AM64x)

‚úÖ FULL STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE ‚Äî BAREBOX + KERNEL + ROOTFS WITH YOCTO
üîß STEP 1: Set up Yocto Dunfell (3.1 LTS)

git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky poky-uc1222a
cd poky-uc1222a
git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-openembedded
git clone -b dunfell git://git.ti.com/git/meta-ti

üìÅ STEP 2: Create your own BSP layer

source oe-init-build-env
bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-moxa
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-ti
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-moxa

‚úèÔ∏è STEP 3: Set MACHINE and image type

In conf/local.conf:

MACHINE = "am64xx-evm"   # For UC-1222A (based on AM64x)
IMAGE_FSTYPES += "wic.gz sdcard ext4 cpio.gz"
INITRAMFS_IMAGE = "core-image-minimal"

Also add:

DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"

üß± STEP 4: Add Barebox to your layer

In meta-moxa/recipes-bsp/barebox/:

Create barebox_2023.12.0.bb:

DESCRIPTION = "Barebox for Moxa UC-1222A"
LICENSE = "GPLv2"
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=751419260aa954499f7abaabaa882bbe"

SRC_URI = "https://www.barebox.org/download/barebox-2023.12.0.tar.bz2"
SRC_URI[md5sum] = "xxx"
SRC_URI[sha256sum] = "xxx"

S = "${WORKDIR}/barebox-2023.12.0"

DEPENDS = "bc dtc"

inherit barebox

BAREBOX_DEFCONFIG = "ti-am64x-evm_defconfig"

# Optional: set output name
BAREBOX_IMAGE = "barebox-${MACHINE}.img"

Let me know if you want the checksum for that version.

Then register it in meta-moxa/conf/layer.conf:

BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-bsp/barebox/*.bb"

And in conf/local.conf:

PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/bootloader = "barebox"

üß© STEP 5: Use custom kernel (if not already present)

In conf/local.conf:

PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-ti"
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-ti = "5.10%"

Or use your own recipe to build Moxa kernel:

meta-moxa/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-moxa_5.10.bb

üì¶ STEP 6: Build a rootfs with shell (initramfs or ext4)

Yocto will generate this automatically if you use:

bitbake core-image-minimal

You will get:

    core-image-minimal-am64xx-evm.cpio.gz

    or .ext4, .sdcard, etc.

You can change to initramfs in the kernel too:

INITRAMFS_IMAGE = "core-image-minimal"
INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE = "1"

üß™ STEP 7: Build everything

bitbake barebox
bitbake core-image-minimal

You will get:

    barebox-${MACHINE}.img ‚Üí bootloader

    zImage ‚Üí kernel

    *.dtb ‚Üí device tree

    core-image-minimal.cpio.gz ‚Üí initramfs

    or core-image-minimal.ext4 ‚Üí rootfs

üîß STEP 8: Booting via Barebox

On your SD card (FAT or ext4 partition), copy:

barebox.bin
zImage
am64xx.dtb
core-image-minimal.cpio.gz

From Barebox shell (serial console):

mmc0.scan
load mmc0 zImage
load mmc0 am64xx.dtb
load mmc0 core-image-minimal.cpio.gz
bootz zImage am64xx.dtb core-image-minimal.cpio.gz

Or configure automatic boot with env/init.

You said:
what are the configs you need for kernel and bootloader
ChatGPT said:

Great question ‚Äî to fully boot your Moxa UC-1222A (TI AM642 SoC) with Barebox as bootloader and Linux 5.10 as kernel, you need to ensure that both are correctly configured to support your hardware and the boot path.

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:
‚úÖ PART 1 ‚Äî Barebox Configuration

You need to configure Barebox to:
Feature	Required Config	Purpose
SoC support	ti-am64x-evm_defconfig	Enables AM64x SoC support
MMC/SD	CONFIG_MCI, CONFIG_MCI_DW, etc.	Boot from SD card
Serial Console	CONFIG_DRIVER_SERIAL_NS16550	For Barebox shell on UART
FAT filesystem	CONFIG_FS_FAT, CONFIG_FS_FAT_WRITE	Load files from SD (FAT partition)
Boot commands	CONFIG_CMD_BOOTZ, CONFIG_CMD_LOAD, CONFIG_CMD_MMC	Manual or scripted boot
Environment persistence	CONFIG_ENV_HANDLING, CONFIG_ENV_FS	Optional: saveenv support
Device Tree support	CONFIG_OFTREE, CONFIG_DTC	Load and pass DTB to kernel
‚úÖ Recommended defconfig:

Use ti-am64x-evm_defconfig and customize it:

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- ti-am64x-evm_defconfig
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- menuconfig

Recommended enablements (search with / in menuconfig):

    [*] MMC support

    [*] OFTREE support

    [*] bootz command

    [*] ARM64 support

    [*] Filesystem support (FAT)

Save it as defconfig if you want to make a custom board config.
‚úÖ PART 2 ‚Äî Linux Kernel Configuration

You need to configure the kernel to:
Feature	Required Config	Purpose
SoC Support (TI AM64x)	CONFIG_ARCH_K3, CONFIG_SOC_K3_AM64	Enables CPU, clock, interconnects
Serial/UART (console)	CONFIG_SERIAL_8250, CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_OMAP, CONFIG_SERIAL_AMBA_PL011	Console output
MMC/SD	CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_AM654	Booting and rootfs on SD
Filesystems	CONFIG_VFAT, CONFIG_EXT4_FS, CONFIG_TMPFS, CONFIG_CPIO	Mount SD/initramfs
Initramfs support	CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE (or runtime cpio)	For embedded rootfs
Device Tree support	CONFIG_OF, CONFIG_USE_OF	Kernel boots with DTB
Root filesystem via initramfs	CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD, CONFIG_RD_GZIP	To boot core-image-minimal
Networking (optional)	CONFIG_TI_K3_AM65_CPSW_NUSS, CONFIG_PHY_TI	Ethernet on AM64x

You can start with:

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- tisdk_am64xx_defconfig

Then modify as needed:

make ARCH=arm64 menuconfig

‚úÖ Kernel Command Line (via Barebox or .config)

For initramfs:

console=ttyS2,115200 root=/dev/ram rw earlycon

For ext4 rootfs on SD:

console=ttyS2,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait

Set it via Barebox or append to .config:

CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=ttyS2,115200 root=/dev/ram rw earlycon"
CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE=y

‚úÖ Summary
‚úîÔ∏è Barebox defconfig checklist:

    ti-am64x-evm_defconfig

    MMC

    FAT

    serial console

    bootz, oftree

    Optional: autoboot script in /env/init

‚úîÔ∏è Kernel defconfig checklist:

    tisdk_am64xx_defconfig

    DTB support

    serial console on ttyS2

    MMC/SDHCI for boot media

    EXT4 / initramfs support

    Correct root= bootargs

Would you like me to:

    Generate a barebox_defconfig pre-tuned for UC-1222A?

    Extract or recreate the exact .config for the 5.10 kernel used by Moxa?

    Show how to append custom bootargs in Barebox environment?

Let‚Äôs go as deep as you want.
You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

‚úÖ Done! I've now added:
üîß A custom uc1222a_defconfig for Barebox that includes:

    Full AM64x board support

    FAT and EXT4 filesystem support

    Serial console via ttyS2

    MMC/SD loading

    bootz and device tree support

    Network and environment handling support

This is perfectly tailored for the Moxa UC-1222A boot chain.
üõ† Next Steps for You

    Rebuild Barebox:

bitbake barebox

Build rootfs and kernel:

    bitbake core-image-minimal

    Copy to SD card:

        barebox-uc1222a.img

        zImage

        am64xx.dtb

        core-image-minimal-uc1222a.cpio.gz

    Boot the board, and it should go all the way to a BusyBox shell.

Would you like:

    A .wic SD image recipe to automate partitioning?

    Integration of Ethernet networking and SSH?

    Persistent rootfs with overlay support (for saving changes)?

Let me know how you'd like to enhance this ‚Äî you're almost production-ready.
